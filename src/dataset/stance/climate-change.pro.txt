Not always, Mars lost its atmosphere naturally.
Nature isn't repairing itself in you now...you're losing brain cells as we speak that won't come back.
Venus's atmospheric pressure suddenly increased turning it into a lava planet with an average temperature of over 900 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead.
I will temporarily become a tree hugger...  We must stop like cutting down trees and stuff. We have to stop driving SUVs and other gas guzzling cars and stuff. And like the movie stars are right, even though they have 15 cars it is us who are killing the enviroment with or SUVs. Uhhh I think thats it man. Like just plant a tree and a garden and dont buy stuff at the grocery store, Im not sure how that will help but do it anyway.    Ok Im back that was kinda scary.
I am part tree hugger, i believe we should not clear cut, that we should keep our wilderness clean, hybrid cars are cool, id own one if i had the money. and I love plants, hell my major, if I finish, is Botany. but I believe this stuff because I drive a Jeep that gets 7 MPG on good days, I drive off-road trails that are in constant fear of closure because people cant learn how to clean up after themselves, and kill vegetation. I care very much about enviromental issues, and always try to do the best for the enviroment, I recycle everything I can, and everytime I go 4-wheelin, I clean up other peoples mess.  ok, back to topic, of course mans affect on the ozone is significant. everything we do affects it, we as humans cant do anything without affecting the enviroment, we may not see the affect for many, many years.
You don't have to be a tree hugger, to care for the environment!:)
good point Debater, I do care for the enviroment, I am a hunter and I use nature like everyone else, I am more for Conservation(using nature, but using it wisely) than for Preservation(not using it at all). Are you for or against hunting?
Having a little bit of conservation and preservation is a good idea. What we most need to do right now is find an alternate fuel source for cars. I mentioned it in our debate about "Bush's real reasons for war", that he donated 1.3 billion dollars to find an alternate fuel source, but that is definitely not enough and somebody should've started this a long time ago. I guess I'm a tree hugger...never really thought about it in that term though :) . You know they're coming out with cars made with hydrogen engines? They're exciting, the only by-product would be water. emoticon_xbouncer Yup, if we're talking about men's effect on his environment, I would say the biggest thing we do to effect it is the fuel gas coming out of our cars.
Those cars are cool! emoticon_cool
The CO2 content is the air is sky rocketing. Why because of man made pollution. The Antarctic ice shelf is melting. Why because of increased CO2. Where did this CO2 come from? Man.  The question was "Is man's effect on the ozone insignificant?"  The amount of ozone has decreased significantly since the rise of industrial expansion.
I think that about sums it up then. Man's effect on the ozone and the environment is far from being insignifigant. Does everyone agree?
And we would die cuz of too much CO2
if CO2 increases the polar ice caps will melt, which will cause an enormous rise in the sea level.
Carbon dioxide is good for plants. etc... I'm confused right now. Could you explain to me? Why did you bring up how good carbon dioxide is for plants and the environment in general, if you later state that the CO2 levels are not rising? If this is true, why did you bring it up in the first place? Sorry, don't mean to be rude emoticon_confused just very confused.
tree huggers, last year over a thousand scientists signed a document stating that CO2 levels were rising.
Nature repairs itself, but too slowly to keep up with humans. We can change things so quickly that nothing can keep up. A good example is water being an absolute solvant. Yes it is absolute, but it takes too long! As for that stuff with mars, you dont know that for sure. All we can do it look at it and guess what happened. There has been many ideas of mars. So yes globla warming exists and its a problem, we can see that from the animals and the messed up weather we are having. Plants just cant take in that much carbon dioxide.   If anything I have said above is not true, please correct me, still learning! :)
hetero-male: you still haven't answered my question. Why did you bring up carbon dioxide in the first place?
don't know. I don't believe in global warming. But I do know that CO2 rates are climbing.
Humans of course are destroying the ozone layer. In the past humans used CFCs, which rose into the stratosphere and broke O3 into *tries to remember meteorology(sp?) class*
Is global warming a real threat or is it just a hoax?
Yes but the polar ice caps are melting!
yes and the reason there is a lot of Termites is because humans are chopping down forests
the US could put sanctions and tariffs on those countries.
I mean sanctions on the wood not on every thing.
Global warming sure is a threat. Some of the Polar Ice Caps already melted. Average temperatures have rised since 50+ years ago at a constant rate. We better stop polluting now, or we will be in big trouble.
Is global warming a real threat or is it just a hoax? I agree it's a threat to us but the point is whether it's really caused by increaing amount of carbon dioxide and how big the threat is. Maybe global warming is just a part of process of global climate change which occured several times long time ago, ie, ice age things like that.  As far as I know, global warming is one of the catastrophe which leads to extinction of human beings. However, there might be another problems which are also big threat to us and all creatures on the earth.  Anyway, I'm not an expert of environment, so I might be wrong but at least I can say it seems there are some bad effetcts of global warming such as rising sea level, abnormal climate pattern, things like that.  We should do something, which might not be appropriate way to solve the problem but it's surely the beginning.
Global warming may or may not be the result of what humans are doing, although it sure isn't helped by our destorying the environment. Now the increasing amount of natural disasters worries me a lot more than global warming which doesn't seem to be progressing to quickly (from winter to early summer, 136 of 140 days were below average temperature where I live). I could really use some global warming up here in Michigan!!! Many natural disasters such as tornados, destructive flood, severe drought probably have something to do with global warming. I don't know which is first regarding these combinations. Maybe flood is caused due to global warming, maybe reverse. These phenomena are related each other, so it can't be seperated when we think about it. Maybe global warming itself is not such a big threat but many disadvantages resulting from this are threats to us.
There is either cause for little concern, or huge concern. The thickness of the ozone layer fluctuates over the years. So in fifty years it could be very thick. But, if it's in one of it's high thickness stages, and there are holes in it in some places, and extremely thinness in others, we're in trouble.
global warming is actually real. it may be cold but the temperature has to do with the angle that the suns rays hit the surface of the earth. so during the winter it will still be cold, but for where i live the heat was above average this winter season. so the enevitable will come and soon enough summer is gonna b a biotch! especially if u live in texas or sum were around there. so yes global warming is real and defianantly not a hoax, and if you wunt stats/proof go onto some of the anti pollution sites and they will tell u numbers.
How often do you hear in the media or from your teachers to take good care of nature? If you consume less global warming causing things like transport, heating, waste etc., you inevitably neglect economy, friends and family, if they live far away from you, health, security in the traffic, if you prefer driving a  small car, etc.. I really regret it that hardly anyone tries to understand the whole issue. And by the way, well, if you try to blame deforesting countries for the global warming, you should first blame yourself. If you use your furniture as long as anyhow possible, much less wood is needed. If you live in a house, which is much better isolated, much less recouces will be required to use it. If you use your car only of necessary, you will use much less recources aswell. If you don't buy expensive glance-magazines, much fewer trees will have to be chopped down for paper production. If you choose to buy only products which were produced in a town close by, fewer trucks will have to be on the street.  Well, you might argue that if you don't consume in such an extravagant way, the economy will suffer from that so that, for example, medical progress will be hampered. But there are alternatives. For example, people always tell that I have to travel abroad, if I really want to learn the English language properly.  I totally agree with them. I prefer watching BBCworld and reading lots of interesting sites on the net. Apart from that, the capability to write properly is more important to speak it properly.   Well, by the way, if you didn't know it before, in terms of global warming, your country is the most careless country of this planet!  If you dispute my statement, it won't be a big deal to find hundreds of internet sites that prove me right.   Well, but I was happy to find this issue here at all!
What are you talking about? The day is still the same length along with the year so it is not that. Have any of you ever heard of the milankovitch cycle? It is the cycle of precession, eccentricity and axial tilt. It causes the tempurature fluctuate so it is at one extreme every 100,000 years. So, we could be moving to a warmer trend.then go back. Another thing about pollution... it was worse in roman times than it is now. We have so many regulations that it keeps the air relativly clean. Here's a site for milankovitch cycle. http://www.homepage.montana.edu/~geol445/hyperglac/time1/milankov.htm  I highly doubt your claim about Romans producing more "pollution" than the billions of contemporary humans. I'd bet they didn't even produce what say Haitians alone are able to do today. The Romans never even dented the ocean's ecosystem. They certainly killed a lot of critters though.
The air was a lot dirtier and everything was really bad. Look at these sites www.hero.ac.uk/uk/research/archives/ 2002/farming_for_the_empire3238.cfm www.nsc.org/ehc/minute/em000311.htm  The first link I couldn't get to but the second is very interesting but I was aware of the history. It's all a matter of scale. While entirely possible that the airborne lead peaked in some distant age, the overall impact(pollution) has never been greater than now.
Awh, now! I bet it was really bad when all the dinosaurs died at one time. Can you imagine?  There have certainly been many times since life appeared on Earth that the "habitability" of the planet has been less than now. I would differentiate between "natural" events and man's efforts.
 Of corse it was cold this year every year is different Globle warming is a yuppie fraud study. I do not beleve in Globle warming. If there was globle warming we would not have snow like we did 2 and 3 years ago. Every thing has been normal that I can tell. Gee I wonder how much money was wasted on this foolish study and brain washing.  Oh yes...because mainstream science is concocting one big hoax just to brainwash you. It's a conspiracy of rabid scientists. emoticon_rolleyes We all know you know much more that scientific peer reviewed journals and the Scientific Method, right? You're scientific credentials?
You don't have to prove the house wrong. THe house has to prove it's right. IT's making a positive statement, therefore it must use credible scientific evidence to prove the positive.
well, global warming can also cause cooling. IT depends. It also causes heating, which can cause melting, which causes more heating, which can eventualy cause cooling.  There's a problem in the arctic ocean right now having to do with human pollution increasing flow of fresh water into the ocean.
 Ice Ages are cyclical. And as I pointed out above, sea level has risen 4" over the last century. One Tsunami does way more damage than natural global warming could ever do.  No kidding. I'll go by the scientific report, however, which states it is a problem.   The amount of fresh water entering the Arctic Ocean from the rivers that feed it is increasing, UK scientists report.  Writing in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, they say the increase is caused in part by human activities and is an early sign of climate change.  The rise in fresh water entering the Arctic Ocean could change the global distribution of water, the team says.  It could also affect the balance of the climate system itself and even possibly alter the behaviour of the Gulf Stream.  The team is from the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, part of the UK Met Office.  Knock-on effects  The global hydrological cycle is the exchange of water between the land, the oceans and the atmosphere. The rate of the exchange is expected to increase as the Earth warms.  Part of the process is likely to mean more precipitation (hail, rain, sleet and snow) at higher latitudes, and so more water flowing down the rivers.  If the global water distribution changes, this could have important social and economic consequences. An altered hydrological cycle might conceivably have a profound cooling effect on north-west Europe as well.  The American Geophysical Union, publisher of the journal, says: "It could also alter the balance of the climate system itself, such as the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, a kind of conveyor belt.  "Cold water flows southward in the Atlantic at great depths to the tropics, where it warms, rises, and returns northward near the surface.  "This flow helps keep northern Europe at a temperate climate, whereas the same latitudes in North America are sparsely settled tundra or taiga."  The Hadley researchers compared data published in 2002 from observations of Siberian river flows with model simulations, to see whether they could identify a human influence on the increase in fresh water.  Making allowances  They point out that higher emissions of greenhouse gases, caused by human activities, are expected to intensify the hydrological cycle in the Arctic, with higher precipitation there balanced by a reduction in the tropics.  They tested the model with four simulations which took into account both human inputs and natural factors, including solar variability and volcanic eruptions.  The results showed a steady increase in river discharges, especially since the 1960s, with the annual rate of increase since 1965 8.73 cubic kilometers, far greater than the long-term trend.  The simulations excluded human impacts in one instance and natural impacts in another, and included all factors in a third.  Dominant part  The team concluded that if there had been no human inputs, the hydrological cycle would have shown no trend at all in the 20th Century.  Over the past four decades, they say, human activity played the major role in the increased flows, and it is likely that the upward trend is part of the early stages of an intensified hydrological cycle.  Dr Peili Wu, a team member, told the BBC: "It looks clear to us that this is an early signal of human-induced climate change. If only natural factors were involved, you wouldn't get these results.  "It is possible the increase in fresh water entering the Arctic Ocean could contribute to an alteration in the thermohaline circulation, because it is diluting the saltiness of the seawater and reducing its density."    David Sington  We are all seeing rather less of the Sun, according to scientists who have been looking at five decades of sunlight measurements.  They have reached the disturbing conclusion that the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth's surface has been gradually falling.  Paradoxically, the decline in sunlight may mean that global warming is a far greater threat to society than previously thought.  The effect was first spotted by Gerry Stanhill, an English scientist working in Israel.  Cloud changes  Comparing Israeli sunlight records from the 1950s with current ones, Dr Stanhill was astonished to find a large fall in solar radiation.  "There was a staggering 22% drop in the sunlight, and that really amazed me." Intrigued, he searched records from all around the world, and found the same story almost everywhere he looked.  Sunlight was falling by 10% over the USA, nearly 30% in parts of the former Soviet Union, and even by 16% in parts of the British Isles.  Although the effect varied greatly from place to place, overall the decline amounted to one to two per cent globally every decade between the 1950s and the 1990s.  Dr Stanhill called it "global dimming", but his research, published in 2001, met a sceptical response from other scientists.  It was only recently, when his conclusions were confirmed by Australian scientists using a completely different method to estimate solar radiation, that climate scientists at last woke up to the reality of global dimming.  Dimming appears to be caused by air pollution.  Burning coal, oil and wood, whether in cars, power stations or cooking fires, produces not only invisible carbon dioxide - the principal greenhouse gas responsible for global warming - but also tiny airborne particles of soot, ash, sulphur compounds and other pollutants.  This visible air pollution reflects sunlight back into space, preventing it reaching the surface. But the pollution also changes the optical properties of clouds.  Because the particles seed the formation of water droplets, polluted clouds contain a larger number of droplets than unpolluted clouds.  Recent research shows that this makes them more reflective than they would otherwise be, again reflecting the Sun's rays back into space.  Scientists are now worried that dimming, by shielding the oceans from the full power of the Sun, may be disrupting the pattern of the world's rainfall.  There are suggestions that dimming was behind the droughts in sub-Saharan Africa which claimed hundreds of thousands of lives in the 1970s and 80s.  There are disturbing hints the same thing may be happening today in Asia, home to half the world's population.  "My main concern is global dimming is also having a detrimental impact on the Asian monsoon," says Professor Veerhabhadran Ramanathan, professor of climate and atmospheric sciences at the University of California, San Diego. "We are talking about billions of people."  Alarming energy  But perhaps the most alarming aspect of global dimming is that it may have led scientists to underestimate the true power of the greenhouse effect.  They know how much extra energy is being trapped in the Earth's atmosphere by the extra carbon dioxide we have placed there.  What has been surprising is that this extra energy has so far resulted in a temperature rise of just 0.6 degree Celsius.  This has led many scientists to conclude that the present-day climate is less sensitive to the effects of carbon dioxide than it was, say, during the ice age, when a similar rise in CO2 led to a temperature rise of six degrees Celsius.  But it now appears the warming from greenhouse gases has been offset by a strong cooling effect from dimming - in effect two of our pollutants have been cancelling each other out.  This means that the climate may in fact be more sensitive to the greenhouse effect than previously thought.  If so, then this is bad news, according to Dr Peter Cox, one of the world's leading climate modellers.  As things stand, CO2 levels are projected to rise strongly over coming decades, whereas there are encouraging signs that particle pollution is at last being brought under control.  "We're going to be in a situation unless we act where the cooling pollutant is dropping off while the warming pollutant is going up.  "That means we'll get reducing cooling and increased heating at the same time and that's a problem for us," says Dr Cox.  Even the most pessimistic forecasts of global warming may now have to be drastically revised upwards.  That means a temperature rise of 10 degrees Celsius by 2100 could be on the cards, giving the UK a climate like that of North Africa, and rendering many parts of the world uninhabitable.  That is unless we act urgently to curb our emissions of greenhouse gases.
Yes. it's called global dimming, and yes, I trust mainstream scientific organizations.  If you knew anything about science, scientists usuallyspeak in terms of COULDS, possibliites, and likely, because science isn't 100% and scientific facts aren't absolute. THey are largely evidence-supported conjectures. You can't prove anything 100%. They are giving reasonable estimates. That's how climatology works.
 Look, I know plenty about science. I'm a scientist by profession and have been for almost 30 years. We talk in terms like "could possibly" and "may" when we're not certain that the phenomenon that we're observing can be causally-linked to another event, condition or factor. When a scientist has a definitive correlation, he uses terms like "does" or "factor X causes phenomenon Y", not "X might conceivably cause Y". When a scientist uses couch phrases like "might" or "could", it means that he doesn't know and it's his hypothesis, not fact. In the real world, I prefer to deal in facts, not SWAGs (scientific wildassed guesses).   1. Not all scientists have the same credentials 2. Not all scientists are proper authorities in all fields 3. ANyone can say he's a scientist online. Need proof before consideration.  Yes. We all know a hypothesis isn't necessarily a fact.  What scientist are you? Where did you graduate? What year, what class? Apparently you aren't a meteorologist or climatologist.
I think global warming is a real threat because yeah the ice caps are melting, animals there will probably sink in that cold water...its getting really hot..everywhere..there are more floods...december is getting hot..and the biggest thing...once i read in a newspaper that well mt.everest was melting and chinese scientist or...said that it got lower by 2 inches and so if these mountains are melting then probably the world will come to an end....water everywhere.emoticon_xdonno
Here's an essay that I wrote for school this year (7th grade) about global warming, .etc.  Tell me what you think! :D  Give Back to the Earth  The Earth has done wonders for all of man-kind for millions of years. The least we could do is give back to the Earth, in return for everything that the Earth has done for us!   All over the world there are people that are harming the Earth, without even realizing it. Sometimes we fail to throw away our trash into its rightful place - a trash receptacle. Instead, we throw it on the ground, and sometimes someone else picks it up, but most of the time, it just sits there. When we write, or print something off of the computer, we waste paper, which is causing people to deplete the world's forests. When we drive our cars, the fuel emits into the air, causing global warming. When we buy something at the store, like a box of cereal, the factory that it was made in emits smoke into the air as well. There are people carelessly animals throughout the world, which causes them to become endangered, or worse, extinct. If all of this continues, our world could end, without notice.  There are many problems in the world today, more than we can all count, because of the fact that most people don't realize how serious this is. We take everything for granted when it comes to the Earth, like everything will always be the same, and we'll all live happily ever after. We are wrong... The effects of global warming, for example, are endless. Global warming is causing the ice caps, glaciers, and Polar Regions of the world, like Antarctica, the Arctic Circle, and areas around Northern Canada, Northern Russia, and Greenland, to melt. What happens is, the ice is made from fresh water, when the ice melts, the fresh water mixes with the salt water in the oceans, which makes a "fresh/salt solution". When the "solution" forms, it makes the ocean currents act strange. The ocean currents are the main source of weather. The "solution" is what's causing all of the ocean currents to produce "mega" hurricanes, tsunamis, and other "freak weather". If the more ice melts, the weather could only get much worse. That is why we must act fast. I am not trying to scare you, or freak you out by this, but this is a very serious matter.  What can we do to help, you ask? You can recycle aluminum cans, paper, plastic, .etc. Before printing something off of your computer, think to yourself, "Do I really need this?" Reuse paper as often as you can. If you're doing an art project, or writing a letter, save the rest of the paper that you have left, or recycle it, instead of throwing it away. If you live in a big city, walk to places more, or even better, ride your bike more often than riding in a car. It's healthier for the planet, and you receive your daily dose of exercise as well! Get your friends involved! Make a game out of it! Ask your teacher or principal to have a Recycling Contest for your school, and the winner of the contest gets a prize, like a bike, or something like that. Ask your teacher or principal to get a school account at a local recycling center, so that whenever students recycle their cans, the money goes to the school. Plant trees around your community, or even in your own backyard! Get involved in your local 4-H. Do research on the internet for other ways that you can help out. Give back to the world, and the world shall give back to you in return!
Here's an essay that I wrote for school this year (7th grade) about global warming, .etc.  Tell me what you think! :D  I'll try to be nice since you wrote it in 7th grade.   The Earth has done wonders for all of man-kind for millions of years. The least we could do is give back to the Earth, in return for everything that the Earth has done for us!  Homo Sapien hasn't existed for millions of years. It would be more appropriate to say that the Earth has provided the basis for life for hundreds of millions of years.   All over the world there are people that are harming the Earth, without even realizing it. Sometimes we fail to throw away our trash into its rightful place - a trash receptacle.  And most of that goes into landfills....  we waste paper, which is causing people to deplete the world's forests.  Not really. World forests are at risk for farm land and non-paper logging, not for paper which is being replaced by post consumer waste at increasing rates. Most paper people use today contains at least some recycled paper.  When we drive our cars, the fuel emits into the air, causing global warming.  It's not just cars and catalytic converters have greatly decreased emissions.  When we buy something at the store, like a box of cereal, the factory that it was made in emits smoke into the air as well. There are people carelessly animals throughout the world, which causes them to become endangered, or worse, extinct. If all of this continues, our world could end, without notice.  Cereal factories aren't that big of polluters. The largest polluters are energy plants with a few exceptions like some of Alcoa's smelters which burns one of the dirtiest types of coal in the almunimum production process. And the world will go from bad to worse, from worse to horrible and from horrible to castastrphoic. Not suddenly. That's day after tomorrow fantasy.   Global warming is causing the ice caps, glaciers, and Polar Regions of the world, like Antarctica, the Arctic Circle, and areas around Northern Canada, Northern Russia, and Greenland, to melt.

When the "solution" forms, it makes the ocean currents act strange.  Flooding is more a immediate problem.   The ocean currents are the main source of weather.  No they aren't. The sun is the main source of weather through the energy transfer from light to various parts of the enviroment.   The "solution" is what's causing all of the ocean currents to produce "mega" hurricanes, tsunamis, and other "freak weather". If the more ice melts, the weather could only get much worse. That is why we must act fast. I am not trying to scare you, or freak you out by this, but this is a very serious matter.  We don't actually know this for sure. There is some data but much speculation as to what is exactly causing larger and more frequent storms. The bigger problem of reducing salinity is the currents themselves and how they intergrate with migration and heat transfer. Sources of food that humans depend upon could disappear if currents drastically change. And the basis of Day after Tommorrow is correct in how the gulf stream helps regulate temperatures in Europe.

Termites produce two times the carbon dioxide that humans do... let's have a war with termites to get rid of some carbon dioxide. :) lol  That was jsut plain silly. A single car will produce more emmisiosn then all the termites in your state.  Rember c02 is one part of the equation.
Hello! I just don't get it why the US is raising the hysteria about global warming. I saw on the Internet a US EPA report to the UN that endorses that "human activities such as oil refining, gas and coal firing are significant causes of global warming". But is it so in actual fact? I think there is yet much to be discovered in the process of global warming.  On other hand, it may be that Washington won't let the rest of the world know the plain truth - that global warming is a result of Pentagon's experiments in the field of climate weapon research. Why not really? Many experts in fact are well in the know.... Do you recall the disastrous hurricane Katherine hitting New Orleans in 2005? Right after this act of nature there were quite few people who doubted that it was some sort of an aftermath of a climate change experiment that had got out of control of American military men. So that's why I also abandon myself to the idea that global warming is in certain connection with Pentagon's secret climate change researches. I think it is like playing with edged tools - no one knows when it would go too far.  What's really a pity is that nobody has braved it so far to plainly blame the USA for global warming.
Simple replication of the meme comes naturally to some. It requires no thought, critical or otherwise. In fact rational thought could actually disrupt the process.
Here here!  emoticon_xhoho  How informative.  Forum Rules;  9. Every post should add relevant information to the thread.
The author, a history graduate, needs no introduction to Brits, but let me share a little background from Wikipedia.  "Via his long-running column in the UK's Sunday Telegraph, Booker has claimed that man-made global warming was "disproved" in 2008[1], that white asbestos is "chemically identical to talcum powder" and poses a "non-existent risk" to human health[2], that "scientific evidence to support [the] belief that inhaling other people's smoke causes cancer simply does not exist"[3] and that there is "no proof that BSE causes CJD in humans"[4]. He has also defended the theory of Intelligent Design, maintaining that Darwinians "rest their case on nothing more than blind faith and unexamined a priori assumptions".[5] [edit]Career"  'Nuff said.
If there is genuine doubt about the science of climate change, where are the peer reviewed journal articles to back it up?
The religious right frame climate change in religious terms in order to dismiss it as untrue, because they already possess "The One and Only Truth".(tm) emoticon_rolleyes
Where did I mention christianemoticon_xclown ? I described a tactic and ascribed it to a group who use it to resist the acceptance of a well established reality. I admit your appelation of the emoticon_xclown appears most apposite in this context.
Global warming is the new religion. Maybe a climatologist who disputes global warming would be like a bishop that disputes the existence of God...someone with little or no future job prospects.  Hardly, a climatologist with proof that there is a different cause for warming and that human CO2 emissions are not and will not cause warming is likely to win a Nobel prize for physics. Good scientists are just as happy when a theory is disproved as when evidence supports it.  Once again, do you have peer reviewed evidence so support you assertions. You can't claim the consensus has broken down and then not be able to find journal articles supporting an alternative interpretation of the evidence. If the articles aren't there then the consensus still exists, and all we're left with is hot air from the denial industry.
Science, anyone?
I'm sorry the first paragraph is just wrong. Global warming suits todays Politicians as much as 'reds under the beds' did in the mid to late 20th century. As stated any scientist that does anything but agree with global warming becomes marginalised.  There does not seem to be much if any resources going into the research of alternative reasons for climate change so many of the so called deniers have just put forward other interpretations of the available data or pointed out where computers models have been incorrect. Global warming MAY be caused by human activity but it is by no means proven.  True story:  "Yes", said the captain of the Titanic. "we came in close contact with an iceberg, and she may be sinking, but it is by no means proven. Let's wait and see while the band plays on" :)
Photos from US spy satellites declassified by the Obama White House provide the first graphic images of how the polar ice sheets are retreating in the summer. The effects on the world's weather, environments and wildlife could be devastating Revealed: the secret evidence of global warming Bush tried to hide | Environment | The Observer
Global warming brings seious and tremendous effects to our environment. We should give a hand in helping save the environment from the effects of GW
Havent China, Russia and Europe got satellites capable of taking photographs of the polar ice caps? If not they could just send a plane! How could Bush keep it a secret? Faux.News and all the Faux.News clones, ABC, NBC and CBS. Not to mention the right wing takeover of PBS.
The evidence is rught in front of you, on your television screen.  Which is why I tossed the TV. American TV sucks!
Doesn't Rupert Murdoch (Faux.News) own most of Chinese TV?  And, I wouldn't be too surprised to learn that he owns a certain amount of Russian TV.
1. The planet is hotter than it's ever been before because we continue to pump CO2 into the air.   Even though our planet is getting warmer, it is still a lot cooler than it was 4000 years ago.  Our pumping of CO2 is certaintly not helping. Does that mean we should pump gasses and make people in big cities sneeze?  2. If all the trees are destroyed, then we will all suffocate due to lack of oxygen.   Most of our oxygen comes from the plants in the ocean and even them oxygen makes up 21% of the earth's atmosphere so we won't be running out anytime soon.  Trees do more than just that. If you chop them down you change the climate, you destroy the homes of millions of animals, and you destroy nature's beauty. Obviously conservatives value 'extra' money more than the home of animals and nature's beauty.  Do you know much of our atmosphere is made of C02? 0.035%!  That makes a large difference you would be suprised. If it wasn't for that, we would be a lot cooler. We always had CO2, if it wasn't for that the Earth would probably be too cold for us in most places. We probably would have never existed if there were '0%' CO2. Increasing numbers in CO2 is certaintly dangerous.  I took a meterology class BTW.
I'd actually be more afraid of the CFCs.  They're the ones combining with ozone in the atmosphere and thinning the ozone layer.
 6. Global warming is a problem for everyone and will make us all hot and miserable!   Did you know that in Siberia they are HAPPY that it's getting warmer up there?    Let's talk about the people in Sri Lanka, which has lost hundreds of acres in the recent past due to climate changes. Who, with just a few more degrees on average, will be completely submerged soon. I have a feeling if we just go democratic on this, there's a few more votes in the tropical region than in the arctic.
[QUOTE=Ness757] Even though our planet is getting warmer, it is still a lot cooler than it was 4000 years ago.   I do not know whether the above statement is true or false, but for arguements sake, lets say it is true.  OK, the planet is not as hot as 4000 years ago. Is that a good thing?  Maybe, but the planet is heating up. And it will not just reach the heat of 4000 years ago and stop. 4000 years ago there wasn't as much toxic gases being released and other forms of pollution. I'm afraid the planet will continue heating and heating. Are we going to sit back and watch our planet's temp rise and rise? Does it have to reach a temp higher than that of 4000 years ago before we acknowledge the problem?
As far as the temperature 4000 yrs ago, it is generally accepted that they were higher. It is also generally accepted that CO2 levels were much higher, which was the cause of the increased global temperatures.  As far as the ice caps melting, they were much smaller then than they are now. Much more of the world was under water at the time.  I think it is pretty well established that increased CO2 levels will increase temperatures on earth. This has been tested on smaller scales in laboratories. There is nothing to suggest that the results of these experiments would not be scalable to the planet as a whole.  As far as the majority of o2 being generated by oceanic plants, it would be difficult or the environmentalists to talk people into "adopting" a patch of seaweed. Trees are big and beautiful. Seaweed is yucky and slimy,   There is a school of thought that says that the oceanic flora that provides the majority of our breathable oxygen is dying due to polution of the ocean. I haven't yet seen any hard numbers on this, so I personally am reserving judgement on this until more research is done.  I think that the dire predictions of "the end of the world" are a l little overstated. It is not the end of the world we are talking about, just the end of the world as we know it. This could allow self corection of the environment of a sort. Last time the global average temperature was 10 degrees higher than it is now, the eastern seaboard was underwater, as was the majority of California. See? The 2 larges polluting regions on the planet underwater. Nevada was a nice lake with all manner of aquatic life.   It was all still there, though. Just different.
Even though our planet is getting warmer, it is still a lot cooler than it was 4000 years ago.   The average global temperature follows a sinusoidal pattern, the general consensus is we are supposed to be approaching a peak. Projections show that instead of peaking, there will be continue to be an increase in average global temperature which exceeds that of the peak 4000 years previous.  Most of our oxygen comes from the plants in the ocean and even them oxygen makes up 21% of the earth's atmosphere so we won't be running out anytime soon.   Your lungs depend on partial pressure to oxygenate your blood. A change in percentage concentration will result in a change in partial pressure. This affects how we breathe. Projections show that with global warming there will be a vast increase in ocean cloud coverage, resulting in inhibited growth and photosynthesis of ocean plants, resulting in a lower yield of O2 on average.   Like I said in #2, most of the earth's oxygen comes from the plants in the ocean and we still have al the other forest.   The other forest does not photosynthesize all year round, the other forest is also in just as much danger as the rainforest. For some reason, radical environmentalists choose to place undue emphasis on the de-forestation of rainforest rather than global forest as a whole.  Like I said, if that were true it would have happened 4000 years ago when our planet was a whole lot hotter.   Ice is stilll ice at -30 or -40. I agree with your point that the earth will not flood, however, your justification is bogus. You also forget that with a temperature increase comes an increase in volume, its not the ice that people are worried about. Furthermore, certain currents are based on regional ocean temperatures and are responsible for the moderate climates in various areas (Britain for one).  There are many scientists that say this is true, but there are many more that say that it isn't   Some references please? In general, it seems that most climatologists agree that severe weather systems will occur more frequently with an increase in average global temperature. (ref:http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/061.htm#1434)  Did you know that in Siberia they are HAPPY that it's getting warmer up there?   And down south wear the majority of people live, they aren't. The people in Siberia won't be too happy when their food source dries up.  Do you know much of our atmosphere is made of C02? 0.035%!  The amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases (CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas) threatens to snowball because of the rapid depletion of available carbon sinks and the consumption of existing ones. The MAIN problem with de-forestations is NOT that the trees are no longer removing CO2 from the atmosphere, but our use of them is adding CO2 to it (burning, etc.) and the other sources we could turn to to remove it are also being used up. Methane hydrates in the polar seabeds threaten to rapidly increase the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases as soon as the temperature increases enough to destablize the ice crystals holding them in place.  added C02 will be boon for flora  The temperature increase will hamper growth about as much as the CO2 increase will help it.  Looking at it from an economic perspective climate change on the scale that the greenhouse effect is causing will do nothing good.
About trees  Trees bind Co2. If you chop down trees you increase the ammount of Co2 in the atmosphere, which is not a really good thing AFAIK.  About climate cycles  Climate cycles have been observed for a long time, and scientists who believe in the global warming theory do argue this on a basis on climate cycles. Apparantly we should be experiencing a "cooling" effect at the moment, but we are not. Scientist therefor fear that when we start experiencing the "heating" effect it will be quite extreme  About changing temperatures.  Changing temperatures do not necessarily mean a bad thing. Most often it do however, and it has nothing to do with us wanting it to be cooler or hotter outside. The temperature is very important for the ecological systems of any given area. If the temperature changes in Siberia this will effect the Siberians deer owners and their possibility to survive. Now, I`m not sure that the current temperature increase will effect the deers negatively or positivly, but if the temperature increase "too much" it would be disastrous for Siberians.   As for tempereatures 4000 years ago.  It might have been higher temperatures, and it might have been lower. But does this really matter? I mean, nobody is saying that humans as a specie will go extinct (unless we somehow kill ourselves with bombs). But an extreme temperature shift will claim lives, cause immense siffering in certain countries (like the SAMOA Islands) and could possibly make our whole economic system to crash. Why risk all of this?  As for melting polar caps.  The polar caps are not important in this respect. Sea levels will not rise dramaticly because the polar caps melt. Butthe sea levels will rise dramaticly if the temperature increases dramaticly. This is because when the water gets warmer, it also grows in volume.
are these numbers backed by any sort of fact ?   Those who dont like to pay a bit more for products to have them produced environmentally safe, tend to point to global warning (which propably isnt going to happen) and say "well, its not happening so theres nothing to worry about"  Im sorry.. pollution does have other causes.   Heavy metals in our water, oxygen death in lakes and oceans, smog, air pollution, acid rain..  We're pumping tons of **** into the air and into our food, and don't care because its cheaper that way.  Take a walk in a large city, then go out into the country side and notice the difference
As far as if all the ice melts it will flood the earth.......Um, isn't most of that ice FLOATING now? Most of it is already in the water/oceans, it's already displacing itself. If it melts, it will then just displace itself as water..whoopee.  Yes, humans do need to be more concerned about what is going wrong with the planet. Yes, we must stop wasting at the speed we are now. Yes, we do need to finds other methods that conserve energy and help to slow the decline in what is left of the hard to replace everything we are and have already used up.  We also need to muzzle some of the more extreme alarmists and control freaks who are more concerned with their being able to control others, than really doing positive things to save the planet.  Don't eat meat, don't eat fish, don't eat anything but plants. WELL, well what about the plants!!??. They have feelings too, ya' know!! Sure, save all those little and big sh*t factories. Then the veggie freaks want you to eat our friends the plants. emoticon_angry   How about going back to a balanced diet? That will include meat, fish, nuts, veggies, the whole works. Check it out....when mankind stood upright and learned to hunt, the we started the upward climb. Protein is needed, protein is meat, fish and fowl.  Shoot the rabbit, the deer, the carrot, the apple, the potatoe wheeeeeeeee.
so earth acts like a big ol' homeostatic equilibrium type thingie mostly  there isn't much we can do to lower the amount of CO2 in the atm, even by not driving cars, humans don't determine how much CO2 is present globally  even if we could artificially drive up the levels, there are things (mostly cyanobacteria and photoplankton) to suck it up and thrive on it  volcanos spew more noxious gases into the atm than all the cars in the world http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Projects/Emissions/vgas_fsheet.html http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/of97-262/of97-262.html  despite what the EPA says: http://www.solcomhouse.com/globalwarming.htm what would they do if they couldn't enforce laws?  i don't think anyone has really found a direct causal link to stratoshperic ozone depletion and CFC use (might be wrong on this)  the only ice that wouldn't just level out with the water is over antartica and greenland  BUT, global warming is real and sea levels are rising, ask any polynesian are we to blame? i don't think anyone really knows for sure  the one environmental problem i can't stand is landfills what are we going to do with it all?
Both of your links = Nothing about comparsion of cars to volcanos.   Unlike many people on boards, I actually read the links.   Unlike your sources, which you apparently didn't read, I actually have something that is irrevelant.  Myth: Volcanoes and the Oceans are Causing Ozone Depletion http://www.epa.gov/ozone/science/volcano.html  well as long as its irrevelant:  who said the links i supplied weren't simply the source of laziness it looked like they gave info as to how much **** volcanoes spew and maybe someone else could look up how much **** cars spew  i don't trust the EPA site either (or the EPA, they just like rules to have some rules and keep their jobs: job-related complaint)   The page only talks about HCl emissions from volcanoes (that spew HCl into the stratosphere, not just the troposhpere). So it's water soluble, it destroys ozone while it's up there, along with all the NOx and SO2. They only vaguely skirt around the issue with no data to back up what they are saying. Yes, CFCs don't dissolve in water but do you really think that we constantly pump out so much CFCs to reduce the ozone layer of the earth? (Don't forget that ozone is constantly being replenished.) http://www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/factsheets/ozone.htm   Here is a site from NOAA and IGAC that tries to compare man-made emissions to natural emissions. Notice the graph that only deals with NOx, NH3, and N2O. Notice the error bars and what they say about the amount of uncertainty. Try to catch the bottom where they glance over xCl emissions. http://www.igac.noaa.gov/newsletter/igac22/natural.html the paper they cite at the bottom was 15 MB so you can download it if you want: http://www.agu.org/journals/jd/jd9907/jd104_7.html   actually that whole page of table of contents has a lot of papers that inventory natural emissions of things (including ozone depleting stuff) and a lot of papers that inventory man-made emissions  i have access so when I get to a T1 connection I'll download them and try to share the info somehow (if I come across this thread again) :)  should be interesting
   Even though our planet is getting warmer, it is still a lot cooler than it was 4000 years ago.    did you know that 4000 years ago the oceans were over 100 feet higher than they are now? Places like Lake champlain were an inland sea, and all of florida was submerged(it's a really big, old coral reef)?   Most of our oxygen comes from the plants in the ocean and even them oxygen makes up 21% of the earth's atmosphere so we won't be running out anytime soon.   did you know that mearly a drop to 19% oxygen is enough to make you pass out?  Like I said in #2, most of the earth's oxygen comes from the plants in the ocean and we still have al the other forest.   what other forest? By your logic there would only be one left in the entire world, and it would be what, the size on central park?  Like I said, if that were true it would have happened 4000 years ago when our planet was a whole lot hotter.   Like i said, it did happen. Also, when icecaps melt, ground, shurbs and water appear where ice once was. These things don't reflect light as well as ice, and makes the earth even hotter. It's a self perpetuating process, humans just started it.  There are many scientists that say this is true, but there are many more that say that it isn't   I'd like to see your source for this...weather is the world's air conditioning. By taking warm water and using it's energy towards precipitation the overall temp is effectively reduced.    Did you know that in Siberia they are HAPPY that it's getting warmer up there?   Acutally global warming causes it to be hotter in the summer and colder in the winter, which is bad for any living thing.  Do you know much of our atmosphere is made of C02? 0.035%! Did you know prior to humans it was at .018%?
Why do some of you guys insist on being rabid haters of anyone who cares about the enviroment. The question isn't why do these people care about the enviroment, it's WHY DON'T YOU??
I'd be happy to play the game - Source? Source? Forest acreage? Source? This one is particularly eggregious. Source?  Waxy  Do your own research. I am not interested in playing a game.
Man made or natural? are you joking?
I have a debate thing in one of my classes and I was just trying to get proof for it. man made: http://www.epa.gov/ozone/resource/public.html  this is the most basic site, but i'm sure there are many links abound.
I have a debate thing in one of my classes and I was just trying to get proof for it.  With global warming at least there is some debate. As far as ozone goes, there is no question that it is man made. Just see the comparison between the ozone hole's size change and CFC usage.
emoticon_xbouncer Of course it is man made. CFC is one of the culprits causing ozone hold destruction. After the Montreal Protocol placed a band on CFC, I believed it was mandated in the 90's the scientists notice that ozone hold seemed to be recovering.
Wow,,,very interesting. Cant wait to see the replies to this.  It is interesting however to be expected. Of course no one here said that CFC's were the only cause of ozone depletion as you seem to think. What was brought up here was the direct link between strong ozone depletion and CFC's. So sure there will be ozone depletion without the use of CFC's but as shown in this thread so far, CFC's are a major offender in the battle to save the ozone. The CFC comparison also shows that man is the primary cause of ozone depletion.
They said CFC was the main culprit. So I went after CFC. If you want to come up with another "reason" then I'm waiting......  In what way did you go after CFC's as far as it being a main culprit? You said nothing to show that CFC's are not a main if not the main culprit of ozone depletion. All you showed is that they are not the only culprit.
I'm bored.....I don't like science anyway, why am I part of this debate?  I'm no scientist either so I'll mention only what I can find proof of on the net. It seems that CFC's are products contain a certain amount of chlorine in them which is proven to cause ozone depletion. That would mean that any other product released into the air that contains any amount of chlorine would also cause ozone depletion particularly if they were not washed back down to earth by rain. Bromine is another element which creates ozone depletion and is found in particals called halons used in fire extinguishers before 1993. The manufacturing of stryrofoam was also found to release ozone depleting chemicals into the air as well as volcanic eruptions and the burning of fossil fuels.  This is what I could find during a quick search of the net. The one thing that I couldn't find that I would have liked to was a photo timeline of the ozone hole from the 1950's (estimated) to today. Anyways, I hope this is what you were looking for.
The fire extinguishers did it! I knew it! They called me crazy, but I was right! HAHAHAHA!!!!!    ::Runs off into the distance::   ::Comes back::   Sorry, had to get some of that sarcasm out of my system.  Sarcastic indeed. I guess you had no where else to go with your debate anyways.
I've even heard... (blah,blah)  That's the qualifier right there. Provide some evidence and then we can talk about natural vs. unnatural.
@syklopps  well than there is no debate, you make the sweeping claim that any information provided is invalid other than research directly conducted by myself.  I, on the other hand, prefer to trust those who I know to do impartial and objective research. But if you are convinced they have an agenda I doubt I will be able to change your opinion to the contrary.  I'm very skeptical of "evidence" that depletion of the ozone layer is man (U.S.) made.  I am very skeptcial of "evidence" that depletion of the ozone layer is NOT man made. (Note: I could care less about the passive-agressive everyone hates americans argument)
Man made or natural?  Whether it is man made or natural or both factors work together; I think it is the beginning of serious changes in the atmosphere.
Lets gt the first thign clear, ozone depletion is not or man threat.  Ozone depletion is both natural and man made. The Poolar Vortex causes a natural depletion. However ozone in that region with out human interaction is still more dense then in regiosn with human interaction.  Yes human interaction has thinned it, it however can replace itself (to a limit). Human production in the past actually was much more damaging then the natural accurance.  The thinning of the ozone that blocks UV light can be less of a threat to the thicking of the atmosphere. UV lights comes in unaffected, however heat does not escape as easily.  Politicians don't care people, get used to that. They hire scientist to spread lies to avoid truth, that has been documented. GLad our tax dollars pay for that. The offiials care about now and their pay checks, not what may happen to society with rising temps, increased drought, facing famine, and what the next few generatiosn will ahve to deal with.  Simple. Put more into space exploration and make an outpost of mars. Get those who are not concerned of the planet.
Couple thoughts... The US has used natural resoursesin the past to bail itself out of a financial wreck. A depression and three big wars.  Environmental considerations are a luxury poor nations do not have, our natural resources have in part allowed that luxury, to deny access to those resourses will eliminate options for the country in the future.....mining, cheap energy, fertilizer, forests....  I think the environmental system the US currently uses if flawed in that it trots out icons that appeal to the public instead of those things that will actually have a positive effect on the world we live in. ie baby fur seals, wolves, a rank old tree that needs to go away, condemning nuclear energy which is by far leaves the smallest environmental footprint of any power sources.  We need to weigh honest cost/benefit to all environmental decisions....cuz the cost can be deceptivly high. Lets not drown the baby in the bath water.
There is no way that any economy is more important than the environment. The economy is an important factor in today's world, however it is not essential to thrive and enjoy life. An economy is no use when everybody will be slowly and eventually walking themselves to extinction.
There is no way that any economy is more important than the environment. The economy is an important factor in today's world, however it is not essential to thrive and enjoy life. An economy is no use when everybody will be slowly and eventually walking themselves to extinction.   The environment -is- a poor nations economy, whereas wealthy nations with modern technology have options. Example: nuclear power instead of stripping a forest of firewood and Email instead of freighting wood based mail around.  People of educated wealthy nations have fewer children, in some cases barely enough to support their population. But both China and India's people are a burden on its environment. Per capita/economic output the US makes a much smaller environmental footprint.  The US has developed 10% of its landmass.
This article:  http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=593660  describes how the Innuit people up north are saying that the US is largely responsible for the climate change that threatens their culture's existence. They say it violates their human rights.  This reminded me of another group of people, Pacific Islanders, who, although are small in number, were a major voice at the Kyoto Conference. They showed that they are losing coastline, farmland, and livable space around the rims of their islands and that whole atolls are being submerged and are no longer habitable because of rising ocean levels. They claim that the rise in ocean levels is caused by global warming and that is caused by human CO2 emissions.  In fact, Tuvalu is also looking to sue the United States and other industrialized nations on the grounds that their pollution is contributing to the situation.  http://www.disasterrelief.org/Disasters/020314Tuvalu/  So, do these folks have a case?

I'm not familiar with the Innuit issue, but Smithsonian recently published a comprehensive article on the South Pacific situation. I don't have any scientific opinions one way or the other, but considering that our energy-aligned administration removed most emission legislation compliance requirements from our energy industry to enhance their profitability doesn't exactly qualify us for international neighbor of the year.
I agree.  And this talk about a 'hydrogen economy' is a smoke screen. Hydrogen will never replace fossil fuels as an energy source because hydrogen is not an energy source. I don't know how much of this is true, but I have heard that the Clinton admin was pushing for stronger emissions regulations on cars, but these restrictions were scaled down without anyone noticing because they were convinced that 10 years from now there will be hydrogen cars buzzing all over.   Unless hydrogen can be manufactured without fossil fuels in any significant quantity and cheaply, the 'hydrogen ecenomy' will never happen.  Just about any energy source can be used to make hydrogen, but then why wouldn't you just use that energy source? You can make hydrogen without using fossil fuels by electrolysing water. You can get the electricity from many sources, but then why bother with the hydrogen? Why not just plug a battery up to the power source and run your car on that? The only advantage hydrogen would have is charge time. It takes a lot less time to fill a tank with gas than it takes to charge most batteries. But would that time saving be worth all the energy you need to expend to split water and then to compress the hydrogen (it takes a lot of energy to do this)?  Anyway, went of on a tangent there.
Nothing will replace fossil fuels until they reach a market price that favors an alternative.
I wish to have a formal debate in the Debate Tournaments section on global warming. I propose the subject title of "Global Warming is both occuring and has been shown to be at least in part caused by human activity"  I will take the afirmative position. Anyone want to argue the opposite?
Redratio1? Gnojek? You both like to claim that global warming is nonsense, so here's your chance to demonstrate it. Are you both admiting you really know jack **** about the topic and are unable to formally debate it?  Waxy, you claim I go too far in claiming that human activity definitely contributes to global warming (I think - never too sure what your real position is on global warming). If you want the wording changed to allow you to take the opposite position, then say...
You couldn't possibly have chosen a more vague or easier to defend position. :p (Other than saying global warming might be occurring)  "At least in part caused by human activity"? emoticon_frazzled C'mon.Perhpas you missed this bit " If you want the wording changed to allow you to take the opposite position, then say..."?  Nor could you have been more arrogant and insulting in doing so. emoticon_rolleyesOf course I could. I was being constrained.  Quite frankly, I think we've been through this, and I don't have the time nor the desire to commit to a formal debate.OK. No probs Mr Yellow Belly :p  ;)
I'll debate you, on one condition. The statement that you must defend is "mankind's release of CO2 will cause global warming" or something similar. No nebulous claims that we "have an affect" or similarly unquantifiable, touchy-feely unscientific position. Not sure I follow you here. But I'll try another title:  "Global warming is a real event that is happening now and its primary cause is human activity"  Any good?  I'll even let you start the debate and I'll go on the defensive right from the start. Deal?Fine.  Oh, BTW, I've traded posts with Waxy for quite a while starting in another forum two years ago, he's anything BUT yellow bellied. emoticon_rolleyesI know. Thus the "wink" smilie.
Since we both agree that global warming is real, how about "Global warming's primary cause is human activity"? You can argue the affirmative and I'll argue the negative. OK?Sounds good to me.  OK, since billsco is chomping at the bit for us to have this debate, let's discuss the details.  I propose: 1. The debate will be "Global warming's primary cause is human activity" and I will argue the affirmative. 2. JPSartre12 will argue the negative. 3. I will start the debate and will be allowed a total of 5 posts. 4. JPSartre12 will be allowed a total of 4 posts. 5. Each party must post a response within 4 days (96 hours) of their opponent posting. 6. billsco shall be appointed "umpire". He will provide three judges (approved by both debating parties) who shall judge the debate and he shall set up the debate thread only once all is agreed. 7. I must post my first post within 4 days (96 hours) of billsco setting up the thread.  Does that meet with your approval, or do you want to do things differently?
Global warming is a controversy. Personally I am like hundred of maybe thousands if not millions of people that think it is liberal ########. The hole in the ozone layer is false, and I am sure this is too. -John Milosevic  You mean that hole that has been observed and proven, repeatedly? Climate Change is a controversy in the same way as the earth being broadly spherical is a controversy. There's a group of nutters who think the earth is flat; doesn't mean there is any reason to believe it is.
Ehh I thought ozone depletion and global warming are not correalted? Also, I really don't think we have enough info to determine if humans are the cause of major global warming.  They're not related, as far as I'm aware. The evidence on globa warming, however, is pretty overwhelming.
We know that we have been releasing large quantities of CO2 above normal levels. We know that CO2 is currently at high levels and increasing in the atmosphere (more particularly increasing at a very high rate, CO2 was higher approx 650000 years ago IIRC, the rate of change is vital, however). We know the link between CO2 and global warming. How much more evidence is needed? The fact that you maintain the fantasy that the world could be as little as 10k years old shows how little grasp you have on the situation.
If my recollection is correct, the atmosphere is approx 80% Nitrogen.   Actually, I've just had a check and water vapour makes up between 0 and 4% of the atmosphere, Nitrogen 78%, Oxygen 21%. CO2 is very low, but that is rather irrelevant as it is percentage change, and the rate of that change, that is important. It's rather like air pressure. If you go straight from 1000mB to 400mB, you will do yourself a mischief. If you go gradually from one to the other, you should be alright. If you go down to 200mB, after a couple of minutes you're pretty much dead whatever happens.
Here's one. There are lots of others.  http://www.envirotruth.org/myth3.cfm   The problem is that taking CO2 and water vapour as bare percentages of the atmosphere doesn't account for the spectra of light which they absorb. In simple terms, the Sun emits radiation in a broad spectrum, which is partly reflected back by the earth, partly absorbed and re-emited. Greenhouse gases have energy levels such that the frequencies of radiation emitted by the earth are similar to those required to raise an electron up an energy level. Some greenhouse gases block more of this spectrum than others.
The Daily Telegraph is in the pocket of big business interests, it's about as trustworthy on this as Exxon Mobil's PR department.  UEA is a respectable university, however, and the latest press release from their website seems to contradict what the torygraph is saying: http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/press/2006-02-hotspots/  I can also quote from the information sheets on the website of the unit: "The year 2005 was the second warmest on record, exceeded by 1998" So, in other words, the torygraph is manipulating statistics and talking out of their collective arses. They chose the two warmest years on record and tried to make something out of the fact that the warmest was before the second warmest.
This article, from the Daily Telegraph, states that data from the "Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia" shows "that for the years 1998-2005 global average temperature did not increase (there was actually a slight decrease, though not at a rate that differs significantly from zero)."  Does anyone know anything about this university (i.e. is it reputable in this area of science)? Also, any thoughts on the author and his interpretation of this data (if the data is reliable that is).  My thought is, don't treat editorials as if they were sources of facts. I went to the CRU website, and their home page has a graphic showing definite warming over the time period in question.  http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/  Bob Carter, the guy who wrote your editorial, is either a fool or not above lying to make a point. The world is clearly getting hotter, all the data supports this. It's not like we're talking rocket science here. All this takes is reading a thermometer and writing down the results, which is a task that people have mastered for quite some time now. Anyone who tells you that we aren't heating up is either in denial, or in the pay of someone who doesn't want to be told to stop polluting.

It's an odd article for Telegraph, though I haven't noticed this Bob Carter bloke before. It contradicts almost all the environmental stories they've done before and comes with an unwelcome seam of personal opinion in the article. If anything it sounds like some of the stuff you hear from the US denying the existance of Global Warming. Jo, I know you don't read the Telegraph but you are way off regarding the normal content.
I also visited the university's website and looked at their data. There does appear to be information which contradicts with the above listed article's claims (e.g. - http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/nhshgl.gif). Not sure what he is talking about.  It is pretty bizzare. There are plenty of groups out there that will reach whatever "conclusion" you pay them to reach. Why he didn't cite one of them instead of an easily checkable source that says the opposite of what he says they do is beyond me.
...theres some good stuff in there.  Not really. Global warming is a fact. The only question is whether we are a significant contributor to it at this time. Btw cars are only part of the problem. Electrical generation 24/7 with fossil fuels is a big concern.
it's about as factual as you get when talking about a chaotic system in 50 years time. There's more doubt about the standard model of particle physics.
I can never figure why those who have no fasith in global warming are usually conservatives. Why is this???
By saying that i don't know if your just ignoring what i said in my post or if your just saying that it is a fact....  If your just saying that it is a fact, well i didn't say it wasn't, i didn't say it was. "i said i believe it to be a crock"...  ITS A THEORY!!!  no one knows enough about whats going on, and if it is its doubtfull that we are the primary contirbutors. Read my previous post and you'll understand, becasue as i said there's some godd stuff in there. emoticon_xgood  Your powers of articulation leave much to be desired but I did read your painful post. The Earth is warming at present. Fact. Maybe you've seen all the ice melting on the news? We are contributing. Fact. Are we the primary cause? Not sure.   So let's just ignore the problem, right? The rapture coming soon anyway.:xbanghead
global warming is not a "fact" as people think it is defined. Is the earth slightly warming? Maybe...but that is the best you can say. You can't state as "fact" the reasons, whether it is natural or not, or whether humans are contributing to it.  Not maybe and not slightly. Yes, it is a fact we are contributing.   Who are "people" and what is "think it is defined"? Oh, I forgot, you're the authority on definitions.
HAHA my powers of articulation leave much to be desired eh...  Well at least im not taken in my pictures of melting ice.  Hey you want melting ice come up here to Canada eh, we get lots. Always have.  Taken in? Those aren't special effects, pal. If we lose the caps we could have a 20ft. rise in sea level. You know how many cities that would flood? Besides, I'd bet most Canadians pray for global warming.:)
Don't worry, i think the problem seems to be undercontrol... If there is a problem....  http://www.globalwarming.org/article.php?uid=175  Did you know that the primary funding for the CEI comes from Exxon?  Wake up, dittohead.
You aren't the authority on stating things as fact either. In fact (pun intended) there are many scientists who don't buy it. I saw a news story yesterday where a Mass. meteorogists said that there are many scientists who don't by that global warming is caused by humans...it is too inconclusive. I didn't state that there is conclusive evidence that it is caused by humans. I said global warming is happening and our activities are contributing.
which is not a fact...  The idea that human contributed to the .5 degree celisius increase is disputed. http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=17798  A 35% increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide since pre-indusrtrial times with no impact? Please.
The important thing is to bury our heads in the sand, and then go fill up our SUV's for a trip to the local shops.
http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/shared/readmore.asp?sNav=pb&id=237  It doesn't matter what the increase in carbon dioxide is because it has little effect. The big contributor to a rise in temperature is water vapor, which we have no control over. Because the atmosphere is mostly made up of water vapor if you were to increase its amount by even 1% you would get a temperature change of 4 degrees Celsius, thats almost a 10 degree fahrenheit change for my friends down South.   One should be careful about basing one's opinions on a single scientific report. Especially one where personal bias can so easily be seen. She's basically saying "No, we should be worrying about (and spending research money on) CO2. The real problem just happens to be in my field, solar radiation, so send your research money my way." From what I can gather her work is not getting very favorable peer review.

From what I can gather her work is not getting very favorable peer review.  In addition, this is right there in black and white:  "Meaningful assessments of the environmental impacts of anthropogenic CO2 are not yet possible because model estimates of global and regional changes in climate on interannual, decadal and centennial time-scales remain highly uncertain."  Nevermind that the two of them are astrophysicists not climatologists.
Alright well I got my information from the second link, if you even took a look at what I sent you would realize that. Vladimir Shaidurov is a man, that's why I think it's safe to say you're purely passing your post on the first link not the second. The first link was merely something interesting to read, the second one under my post was where I got my info. Sorry I take part of the blame I should have labeled them a little better.  Evan,  Those "enviromental whackos" may be extremist and even misguided but why trust those who have a monetary stake in disproving global warming? Can you see how this meteor theory is so difficult to substantiate as to be perfect for clouding the issue for who knows how long? Perfect if you are in the fossil fuel business. I'd bet they're begging to fund his research.
Didn't we have a Ice Age at least once wherein glaciers formed far south of where they are now? I suspect things have warmed up quite a bit since then.  According to one seemingly valid source, the earth has had four periods of Glaciations in which ice covered vaste amounts of what are now occupied areas. That means global warming was followed by global cooling, then again by global warming and cooling. The last Ice Age was some 18,000 years ago.  Get out your winter clothes! Here comes another Ice Age!emoticon_xhoho
There are several theories out there, and it appears that liberals choose to accept Human interference. Why? because environmentalist have blown up this particular theory because it point figures at us, when this happens the public wants hasty action and the liberals ease their guilt by throwing money at programs such a Kyoto.   Let's focus Evan. Why do liberals want to fingers at us? Because of guilt? What guilt? Because they just want to spend money? Why? Now if you said because they're simply anti-capitalist, anti-industrialist, I could imagine that.  Have a look at these glaciers and ice fields: http://www.worldviewofglobalwarming.org/pages/glaciers.html

Now if you said because they're simply anti-capitalist, anti-industrialist, I could imagine that.  Have a look at these glaciers and ice fields: http://www.worldviewofglobalwarming.org/pages/glaciers.htmlI do not doubt global warming is occuring as we speak. However, I have long been skeptical of comparisons made on the basis of two pictures of snow covered mountains. The glacier pictures are more telling. The snow pictures could have been made in exceptional years...one with exceptionally little snow and one with exceptionally heavy snow.  As to the cause, I suspect we are somewhat at fault. However, I also believe it is a naturally occuring thing that we are simply speeding up. We're due for a non Ice Age melting of the polar caps in about 50,000 years. Then we'll have about 200,000 years without ice caps and then another freezing period. All IMHO of course.
i would have though there was more vested interests in denying global warming that agreeing with it
Now now, come on. Let's focus here. Why do liberals point the figure at us? They blame the American people; they tell them that they are all wrong, humanity as we know it is evil. Mother nature's only true predator is man! They've imbedded in part of the public that they people of the Untied States of America are bad people.   "Wait a min, you mean its my fault... o man, I can't believe it.... SOMETHING MUST BE DONE!"  And the liberals say "Well it's true, but you are not condemned to hell, we can safe you immortal sole. We will impose taxes and regulations and you will be cleansed." Then they lean to their comrades and laugh quietly.  Why do they do this? Well it's because they have an on going mission to have a larger government, more victims and guilty Americans, and yes it would appear that they have a vendetta against Capitalism. Environmentalists do not consider America to be the only country hurting the environment. We just have the largest number of people with a high standard of living. That standard has an environmental cost. Would you agree with that?
I don't understand why these environmentalists choose to jump to hasty conclusions, and keep trying to implement solutions to problems they really have no knowledge about and insufficient information, much like the Kyoto protocol. And yet you accept the word of a drug addicted glutton with no scientific background whatsoever. Why is that?
We have a huge responsiblity towards the planet... that pro choice attitude has been running right through humanities attitude towards nature for a very long time "its my planet, I can do what I want with it" but we cant... We arnt the owners of the planet we are the planets guradian, our attitude towards the earth and nature should be to care for and cherish our natural habitat   obviously we are the "crown of creation" the highest form of life on the planet, now the topic at hand shows how the words of christ are filled with eternal wisdom "the greatest among you must be your servent" as the highest form of life on the planet we have a resposiblity to the earth, to serve it, but we have made it serve us, we have plunded our natural habitat instead of nurturing it, embracing it we have only looked to take from the earth and again christs words ring true in my ears "it is better to give than to recieve" and I think its beyond time we gave something back to the earth.   In christian teaching, with the resurection of christ it wasnt only humanity that was raised up, it was the whole of creation, the world and everything in it became the footstool of christ, almighty god and everyone and everything had to be respected and loved as creatures of god and christians were given the task of bringing this good news along with the fact mankind had been given the opportunity to accept and once again take up our responsiblities as "crown of creation" and become the "new tenants" in his "vineyard"   christ said " I am the saviour of the world"   his teachings certainly support this statement especially in todays world because becoming servents of the world and giving to it instead of recieving from it and plundering our natural habitat is the only way creation can survive... Its no longer a matter of the "right thing to do" its a matter of our salvation.   People say christianity has no meaning, no relevence to our time, and many ask me how I know Christianity is True..... if only people would open their eyes!
Way off. Dinosaurs were around from approximately 248 million years ago till 65 million years ago. 248-65= 183 million years.  Humans are at what, maybe 60,000 years?   The earliest skeleton of 'modern man' is about 195,000 years old.  There is genetic evidence that modern man went through an 'bottleneck' event about 70 to 80,000 years ago.
"humble ape?" LOL! Do they keep them in separate cages at the zoo?  You don't get the point. I didn't think you would. That would require INTELLIENCE.
So, Trebor butchers "intelligence," like I thought he would. LOL!   So, I can't spell. On the other hand, I understand people. And I am not someone who has too much starch in their shorts, and is so unhappy with themself and the world (like you are)
Why is it the religious people are obsessed with spelling?  I have a theory:  In a chat room anytime someone misspells something it is all ways the women that scorn the evildoer.  Religious men are obsessively homophobic which we now know thanks to the advanced modern science of psychological stuff is repressed homosexuality, meaning they like boys.  Therefore and in conclusion they are girls.   Stop insulting girls
Oh ok, sorry girls!  Maybe girls will like me better now?   You never know till you ask ;p
Here's an interesting way to deal with global warming:  http://www.crnc.org/index.php?content=beach  You mean, with denial of the fact???
I recall Al Gore's book about the environment. It was so technical, it was unreadable. It was funny when George Bush 41 referred to Gore as "Ozone Man" because of his preoccupation with the ozone layer. I have read the ozone layer repairs itself. Maybe. The big issue with Gore is global warming. This is the tendency for man-made carbon dioxide to trap heat in Earth's atmosphere. The fear is, the earth will be heated to a point that its polar caps melt, inundating coastal cities. Unchecked, Earth could become a hell like Venus although we would be dead long before. The problem I have is that geologists say we are between Ice Ages. If another Ice Age is inevitable, might not global warming serve as a device for heating the globe? Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may trap the sun's energy and prevent glaciers from flowing north and south to drive the planet's population toward the equator. It sounds crazy. We are trying to figure out whether we will burn up or freeze to death, whether we are going to drown or die of thirst because all the water is locked up in ice. If global warming is taking place (and apparently it is), I am not sure it is an entirely bad thing. It got pretty cold in Nashville last winter. If it is a bad thing, I am not sure that man in his ingenuity will not find a remedy. I stay mainstream.
I Believe that the world will reach a certain heat, (warm enough to melt enough ice to stop the gulf stream) at which point the UK and Europe will dramatically cool to a more siberian temp. If Anyone who reads this has seen the film "the day after Tomorrow you may think im this science fixtion. However after researching on the possibility i discovered that if enough fresh water were to flow south to the Gulf Stream it would be cut off sue to the different densities and such. Any Comments?
The day after tomorrow IS science fiction, at least bits of it are. There's no way the sea could cool as fast as the film suggests, for example. Any temperature change is likely to be far more slow. Climate change is the preferred term rather than global warming precisely because the precise local changes are not predictable, the warming is only the average. Whatever happens, most people in the US and Europe will survive. It's everyone else that gets screwed, because we can afford to mitigate the effects, while they can't. The problem comes for us when India is flooded with 300 million Bangladeshi refugees and harvests fail, sparking religious violence, triggering war with pakistan, rising to nuclear exchanges... and on, and on. Basically rapid climate change will have a massive destabilising effect, even before we consider the moral responsibility we have to those people whose lives we just screwed up.
Except that we have a known causal link between human activity, greenhouse gases and temperature change. There is also the rate of increase that is unusual. If temperatures had risen over the last 10,000 years as quickly as they're rising now, the sea would pretty much have boiled.  As for the allegation that environmentalists are in this for the money, how many multi-millionaire environmental campaigners are there? How much do you think the director of Greenpeace makes? Want to compare that with the oil barons?
But greenpeace isn't like any other company, because it's not making any money. Its leaders get paid little compared to the CEOs of similar sized companies. If you're prepared to believe Greenpeace is engaged in a conspiracy to lie about climate change, why are you prepared to believe the information churned out by the oil industry and its paid lackies, where you really can see the money trail?  As for that graph, look at the scales for a minute. CO2 is currently running at 380ppm, the top of that graph is at most around the 300 million mark. Yes there are natural cycles, but we are beyond the extremes of the cycle suggested by that graph, and the link between CO2 and warming is a simple matter of fundamental physics.
Climate-change is a better phrase then global worming, because man-made changes are happening that are causing other issues other than just warming. This has led to some confusion among those who have been duped into believing that climate-change isn't happening.
Robertson, like the proverbial stopped clock, is sometimes right by sheer luck.  As for your second point, 9 of the 10 hottest years on record have been in the last decade. The fact that there are local variations is neither here nor there.
Maybe. There's good scientists on both sides of the issue. No. There really aren't. If you want to live in LaLa Land and pretend climate change isn't happening, be my guest, but don't try to make it seem as if there is some major controversy in the scientific community about it when there isn't.
Maybe. There's good scientists on both sides of the issue.  But regarding Robertson, he's not basing his views on science at all. He's basing it on the fact he was hot the other day.  No, there really aren't. As for Robertson, why do you think I said he was right (as in global warming is happening and we are largely responsible) by sheer luck?
No, it's been claimed before in other threads, and all that has come up are people who don't specialise in the subject or people on the pay roll of the oil companies.

The issue is not whether the earth is warming--that's not what being on the other side of the global warming debate means. The issue is, assuming it is getting warmer, whether the cause is natural or because of humans.  That's an interesting question, but does the answer really matter? We know the Earth is getting warmer, and we know this will have devastating effects on millions if not billions of people. Given that, shouldn't we do everything we can to reverse the trend, even if we aren't the primary cause? We know that greenhouse gases can contribute to warming, so even if we can't prove that they're causing the current warming trend, shouldn't we cut them anyway, simply because that's all we can do?
It would be bad to waste your time when you coulda been spending resources on a way to actually identify and fix the problem assuming there is one  Well, first off we don't have to assume that there's a problem. We know that average temperature are increasing; it's not rocket science, it just takes reading a thermometer and writing down the result. That aside, what you say is true in general, of course. But in this particular case cutting greenhouse gas emmisions is all we can do. It's the only thing that can have an effect that's under our control. There is simply no way to know, with 100% iron clad scientific certainty, what's casuing global warming. But we do know, with absolute certainty, that greenhouse gases could be responsible to some degree, and that if that's the case then reducing emmisions would help. There are other theories as to what's behind global warming, but none of them involve anything that humans have control over. At this point we only have two options. Do the only thing available to us that might help, or do nothing. Considering what's at stake, doing nothing seems like a trully horrible idea. Even if greenhouse gas emmisions aren't the root cause of global warming reducing them could still help. If you know of anything else that we could do that has a chance of helping I'd love to hear it, because from what I've read this is our only option.
Let's look at that list shall we?  Patrick Michaels - known to have received money from at least 1 energy company, and edits the World Climate Report which is funded by the Western Fuels Association, major suppliers of coal in the western US.  Robert Balling - reported to have received $400,000 from oil and coal companies including Exxon-Mobil  Sherwood B. Idso - of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, has been on the pay roll of Western Fuels and received money from Exxon-Mobil.  Fred Singer - one of the more amusing candidates, veteran rent-a-scientist for not only Exxon-Mobil but for big tobacco firms needing a stooge too.  Richard Lindezen - reportedly received $2500/day for consulting on behalf of oil and coal companies, and has links to the WFA front organisation Greening Earth.  Frederick Seitz - specialism is in solid state physics, yet feels himself qualified to talk on both tobacco effects and global warming. Funding of his SEPP organisation remains obscure, though he is believed to have links to the Moonies.  William M. Gray - so far the only one who doesn't appear to have dubious funding sources. However, while he may be perfectly qualified to dispute the effects of warming on hurricanes, the fact remains that he is not a specialist in the area of warming itself. As far as I can tell he has not published papers on the subject.  Roy Spencer - a supporter of intelligent design which suggests his scientific credentials are suspect right off the bat. Again, his papers are not on the issue itself, but solely on temperature monitoring.  So we've got 2 guys in areas semi-detached from the subject, one of whom is prepared to substitute religion for science when it suits him, and the others of whom is a conspiracy theorist. Hardly a brilliant selection of "good scientists".
My statement was that opponents of global warming are either in the pay of the oil companies or not specialists in the field. I have just stated which and how this applies for each of those listed. If you want to make the claim that their science is good, feel free to state the science and explain how it disproves the overwhelming body of evidence in favour of anthropogenic warming.
 If humans aren't the cause, then why should they, given the regulatory and economic issues involved. If it's going to happen regardless.  Even if we aren't the primary cause greenhouse gases are still probably contributing. Even if temperatures were going to rise anyway we're probably pushing them up faster and higher. Basically, we only have one thing we can do, there's only one knob we can turn. It may halt global warming, it may just slow it down, there's even a non-zero chance that it won't do a thing. But given that it's the only knob we have, and given how disasterous inaction will be, how can we do anything but turn it?    And just so you don't misinterpret my statements (as a lie or whatever else), let me add that I'm not necessarily siding with those against global warming here.  Don't worry, I have no trouble telling the difference between a lie and a difference of opinion. I am, however, having trouble with the phrase "not necessarily siding". Telling us what you might not be doing is all well and good, but how about telling us what you are definately doing. Do you have a stance, or are you undecided?
That may be true; but it needs to be weighed against the cost of making such changes (and I'm not saying I know what those costs are; i don't), as well as the repercussions more regulation.  It'll cost the oil and coal companies, that's fairly certain. But the development of new technologies will spur the economy in other ways. And of course if it works the savings would be huge, both in terms of property damage avoided and loss of human life. I don't know what the final costs would be either, but given what's at stake there's no way they can be too high to try. The drain on the economy would be tiny compared to, say, the Iraq war, and the potential benefits are huge. Likewise, the costs if we do nothing could be staggering.   I already have, more than once now: that there are good scientists on both sides of the issue.  That's true, you did say that. But you also said "let me add that I'm not necessarily siding with those against global warming here." , and that's what I was asking about. Which side of the issue, if any, are you on? Do you think people are responsible for global warming? Contribute? Have had no effect? Or do you not have an opinion?   That's what Jo Bennett disagreed with, and it's the discussion you weighed in on. No, the topic I weighed in on was this statement of yours: "The issue is, assuming it is getting warmer, whether the cause is natural or because of humans." If you don't want to discuss this with me and the merits of various scientists with Jo at the same time I'll yield the floor. Just say the word.
I suspect you have no degree in a related field such as climatology, and yet you claim some very well-known and good scientists are not good scientists: As I recall Jo Bennet is a Physicist of some description, (Also a member of the CofE which makes what is said elsewhere somewhat bizare.) ID isn't science, the Authors (Behe and Dembski) admit that it is religously inspired and the Judge in the recent case declared that it was Creationism, even the Vatican Observatory denounces it as psuedoscience. I'm a Zoologist, so I deal with the effects of climate change as it effects populations of animals. There is something of a Silent Spring effect taking place.  I will draw your attention to three articles in New Scientist; US report backs study on global warming A report commissioned by the US Congress backs findings that the past few decades were the warmest in 400 years 23 June 2006 Breaking News   US Supreme Court to rule on climate change The court will decide whether the evidence for global warming is sufficient to merit controls on carbon dioxide emissions from cars 27 June 2006 Breaking News   US Congress starts to believe in climate change A weighty report concludes that the controversial 'hockey stick' graph showing global warming this century is real 01 July 2006 From magazine issue 2558 News   The "Hockey Stick" graph shows the change in CO2 levels in the atmosphere, almost stable since the last glaciation, which show a sudden and increasing rise in CO2 since the start of the Industrial Revolution.
Ok Jyoshu, or anyone else who feels like taking up the challenge. If this issue is so hotly contested, find me two scientists meeting the following criteria: 1. has published in a peer reviewed journal 1 or more papers contradicting the core science of global warming directly 2. is not receiving income or grants from any organisation with a vested interest in greenhouse gas emissions larger than the income or grant. Find me these and I'll stop disputing that there are competent scientists on both sides.
That may be, but the question is, how far is just "trying"? Specifically, what do you mean in terms of regulation and dollars spent? A blank check and all-powerful unchecked Big Brother on drivers, consumers, companies, etc. is NOT a good thing. And if you mean anything less than that, then tell what your solutions are, specifically. Anyone can say we should "try." Well of course I'm not talking about an "all-powerful unchecked Big Brother", that's just silly. And I don't have a specific set of policy statements prepared. At this point simply getting people to conceed that anything should be done is enough of a challenge. Once we can get people to agree that change is necessary than we can sit down and hack out the details of which changes, how much to spend, what time frames, etc etc. There's no point in trying to convince someone that cutting emmisions 15% over 5 years at a cost of $5 billion is the way to go if they won't even conceed that we should be trying to cut emmisions at all.     At this point I think "contributing" is the most I could say, but maybe not even that. I'm still reading various views and opinions. If you have any specific questions, maybe I could help.   And no, I'm not interested in seeing who's meeting Jo's guilt-by-association criteria for what's a good scientist; she still has the ties-to-energy-companies qualifier in play (the #2 thing she listed). That doesn't speak to whether or not they are good scientists. So did you catch the bit where I said that wasn't what I was discussing with you? emoticon_xangel
Waxy, would you mind giving me a link to Tad Murty's work on climate change? My googling isn't telling me much more than that he's an expert on tsunamis, which as far as I'm aware have nothing to do with climate change.  Jan Veizer seems well intentioned, but his cosmic ray theory has been fairly thoroughly demolished and he has been accused of fiddling his data, by up to 40 million years, to show a correlation between temperature and cosmic rays which the data simply doesn't support, and he's even more guilty of what the anti-climate change group accuse scientists of - relying on insufficient data. It's worth looking into, just to make sure, but in any case it's an alternative hypothesis, with gaping holes in it, and it doesn't do anything to contradict the science underpinning the greenhouse effect.  Ross McKittrick is an economist, he hasn't done any work on the science of climate change. Steven McIntyre is, again, not a scientist. He's a semi-retired businessman, and I can't find any published works of his regarding the science of climate change.  Incidentally the reason I want to exclude scientists in the pay of the oil companies is that if the dispute is significant, there would doubtless be scientists not bought and paid for by big oil who would be on the minority side. I'm not saying that science paid for by the oil companies is automatically suspect, but the experience with tobacco and lung cancer should teach us a lot about trusting data from big businesses with a vested interest in the status quo.
Ah, the infamous "hockey stick" graph, done by Michael Mann. That graph has been discredited by numerous statiticians who reviewed his work and methodology, "Their task was to look at Mr. Mann's methods from a statistical perspective and assess their validity. Their conclusion is that Mr. Mann's papers are plagued by basic statistical errors that call his conclusions into doubt." (WSJ, 7/14/06) It wasn't discredited, indeed the US congress said;  "We roughly agree with the substance of their findings," says Gerald North, the committee's chair and a climate scientist at Texas A&M University in College Station. In particular, he says, the committee has a "high level of confidence" that the second half of the twentieth century was warmer than any other period in the past four centuries."the 1990s are likely the warmest decade, and 1998 the warmest year, in at least a millennium",  http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060626/full/4411032a.html This paper is far from alone, I for one haven't seen any papers in the peer reviewed journals that dispute the correlation between the industrial revolution and the rise in CO2.  Specifically regarding the statistics: The NAS also confirmed some problems with the statistics. But the mistakes had a relatively minor impact on the overall finding, says Peter Bloomfield, a statistician at North Carolina State University in Raleigh Indeed Jo Bennet's remarks regarding vested intrests springs to mind; An Economist, someone in mineral exploration (Oil prospecting) and a Republican poltician from Oil producing Texas...
Greenpeace et al aim to protect the planet. If it turns out it doesn't need protecting in this area then no-one will be happier than us (I'm a Greenpeace supporter). Feel free to exclude scientists funded by these groups if you so wish, it still leaves an overwhelming consensus among scientists working in the field.  You're not qualified to evaluate climate models if you don't know enough about the climate. If McKittirck's work was scientific it would be published in a peer reviewed scientific journal, not an economics one.
With the rest of the money we should continue researching and deciding what actually is causing global warming. No use barking up the wrong tree when you can find the right one :)  Again, if human emissions aren't the cause then we're pretty much screwed, since they're the only potential cause that we can do anything about, so searching for other causes before doing anything about emissions really doesn't make much sense. And, of course, if human emissions are the right tree, and we waste too much time and money checking every other possibility, it'll be much, much harder to do anything about it. There could very well be a "tip over" point past which merely stopping emissions won't reverse the trend. Just something else to keep in mind.
Right, I conceed that there have been a small number of papers published atacking some of the methodology used by some proponents of global warming, and there are a small number of people with credible knowledge of the field who have different theories about the warming. Now is either Waxy or jyoshu prepared to concede the overwhelming consensus in support of anthropogenic warming, and that the media is massively over-emphasising the tiny number of dissenting voices?
Bravo Jo Bravo!
I believe that the general consensus it that the earth is warming. I agree with that.  The majority believe it is anthropogenic, an overwhelimg consensus - that's a stretch.  I don't believe that there is any consensus whatsoever regarding what the impact of the warming is/will be, what can/should be done about, or how to go about doing anything.    No offense Joe, but I laughed out loud when I read this.  The media overemphasizing the dissenters? You have got to be kidding. It is nearly impossible for dissenting voices to be heard by the media.  The general public is bombarded on a daily basis with global warming paranoia. Extreme weather, ice caps disappearing, global flooding, every day a new record temp, etc.....  There are feature length movies made by former vice presidents playing in theatres around the country that are sounding the global warming alarm bells, and you actually have the audacity to suggest that the media is over-emphasizing the the dissenting voices? Try to find me 3-4 "anti global warming" stories of any kind garnereing attention in the current mainstream media. You lost some major credibility points with me on this one Joe.  Waxy    I really have to put a point in, it my not be valid as I did sort of just "jump" into this forum, so if because I wasn't a part of the start of this forum my point is non taken that's fine with me but.... Again Waxy you are talking about ALL the actions that might/will happen now think of the IDEA behind the actions..... Water level increases less land.... less land faster over population.... faster over population.... more control over the people.... more control over the people less freedoms..... open your mind man you are s blind......
I don't concede that global warming is even a bad thing. It is. Any point trying to convince you of this? And that's a serious question.   If it is a natural climate pattern then whats the big deal?  You can't actually mean what you just said, but I can't figure out any other way to interpret it. If something's natural it's no big deal? A hurricane that causes billions in damage, or a tsunami that kills thousands are no big deal, because they're natural? Try again, I'm sure that's not what you were actually trying to say, and I have no clue what you really meant.
I don't concede that global warming is even a bad thing. If it is a natural climate pattern then whats the big deal? Some of the projections suggest over a billion people dying as a result, and it's already started. Exactly how bad does it have to get?  There isn't "Universal Concensus" on the world being round, I can't think of a single scientist I've met who seriously believes the cause of global warming is anything other than human in origin in all the time since I first went to University.  You don't dispute that Warming is occuring, do you dispute that CO2 is a Greenhouse Gas or that the activities of people since the industrial revolution have increased the volume of CO2 being put into the atmosphere?

Giving thats its a fairly general global warming debate...  The overall consensus (regardless of who's consensus we're using;)) is that global warming is happening, and there is some pretty disasterous results predicted because of this. However, if humans are responsible for the rapid increase, surely it would make more sense to direct as much funding as possible to deal with these rather than risk going primarily on prevention when its not known whether its possible to undo the damage/reverse the trend?  I'm all for environmental advances as generally they result in better long term efficiency and greater sustainability, however unless serious effort is made to drastically reduce existing greenhouse gas levels as well as the rates they are being produced then its not going to make a lot of difference when something like New Orleans 2 occurs.   What sort of measures would be required to deal with the biggest problems (moving developments away from vunerable areas and toward safer ones etc) and are they things above and beyond what is actually possible?
"As much funding as possible?" What does that mean, exactly? Funnel money away from other areas we need it? I mean, sure, we could eliminate every domestic and foreign military spending item the US engages in and put our entire national budget into dealing with global warming if we wanted to. But would that really be wise? I don't think the issue with much of anyone is whether it should be funded to ANY degree, but rather how far we're willing to go with it. What people don't get sometimes is that the US is already pouring MORE into environmental issues such as dealing with greenhouse gas emissions than any other nation in the world. We'd have to directly shut down oil companies (which would be a fascist thing to do) in order to truly force the US to stop using oil, and the ramifications of such a sudden action on our economy by doing that would do worse to the environment than anything. I was thinking of the money allocated toward global warming related projects - it appears at least that the balance is heavily weighted toward prevention/reduction and I don't think I've really heard of much at all being spent on dealing with what seems to be inevitable (relocating homes and businesses away from endangered areas, strengthening and improving storm defenses etc)   Other than forcing the public to change by big-brother efforts, what other 'efforts' could be taken? It's not like people in the US don't know we need to be less dependent on oil. We could as a nation, I suppose, make symbolic gestures like ratifying the kyoto protocol. But with the UN giving complete exemption to the 2nd largest greenhouse gas emmission source country in the world, and the fact the treaty heavily affects trade issues, it's pretty hard to take the UN seriously on it. And if we are serious about cutting emissions (we have, a lot, already), we don't need a Kyoto protocol to do that. This is partly my point, if you're not going to really throw everything into trying to stop it, surely it makes a lot of sense with making sure you can survive the consquences. At some point the government is going to have to be a bit cruel - either get out of the red zones or you will receive no funding or assistance to rebuild if the area floods or is devestated by a storm, that is really the nicest way it could be done if you aren't going to accept forced (but subsidised) relocation.
Some posters have claimed that there is "debate" over the cause of Global Warming being human in origin. Amongst those that claim it is a natural phenomenon are those that claim that climate change is due to solar activity. However whilst this may be true in a historical context, data of solar activity shows that solar activity has not reflected climate change for the past 30 years. The latest edition of New Scientist states precisely this. www.newscientist.com
In the UK a major report has been released on Global Warming and the dire consequences facing us if we do nothing.  The Governments' response has been the predictable one. 'We can raise more taxes'  There are at least two questions. How will taxing people of one small island reduce the levels of global warming ? What will the taxes so raised be used for ? Suspicion that another department of bureaucracy will be needed to monitor everything and predictably do nothing but will need paying for.

Suspicion that another department of bureaucracy will be needed to monitor everything and predictably do nothing but will need paying for.  Seems to me there's only one question. Is the report correct? If it is then we need to do something now, and pay for it now. Yes, we need to make sure we do the right things, but on that list is not sitting around saying "Oh noes!!11 The taxes!!"   People have been more than willing to dump pollutants into the environment without much thought or foresight, but when it comes to spending money, then we need to sit back and consider the long term ramifications, come up with a twelve point plan, make sure everything is thought out. Screwing up the world? Go ahead, we'll deal with the consequences later. Spending money to deal with said consequences? Hold on there, not so fast, we need to think about that before we do anything rash! More and more reports are coming out saying that "too late" is upon us; this is not the time to pinch pennies. Even if money is all you care about, try to estimate the financial impact of NY city being flooded or the midwest turning into a dust bowl and ask if spending some money now wouldn't be worth it.   (Sorry, don't know British geography well enough to give British equivalents for climatic disasters)
Agreed the accuracy of the report is always something that has to be considered. It is only a prophecy by an economist given certain events happening.  The point is that it look more as if the Government are taking the opportunity to raise more taxes for the sake of raising more taxes and do absolutely nothing.  Is the money raised going to do something towards lessening emissions ? No evidence of that at all
 The point is that it look more as if the Government are taking the opportunity to raise more taxes for the sake of raising more taxes and do absolutely nothing.  Is the money raised going to do something towards lessening emissions ? No evidence of that at all  Than what needs to happen is for people to demand that the government does something. Most politicians have trouble thinking past their term in office. They're probably more than happy to say "Problem? Let's raise taxes", wait for the expected outcry, and then say "Well, I tried" and drop it. People need to stop worring about the money and complain about the lack of action.
Because most of the proposed taxes are regressive, those of us on the left favour a personal version of the carbon ration system currently being implemented in Europe. Each person has a limited amount of carbon they can emit over a given period of time. If they don't need it all they can sell part of their ration to those who want more to fly to australia or whatever. Much better than forcing poor people in rural areas off the road and allowing rich city dwellers to keep their 4x4s, which is what taxation is likely to do.
Well the introduction of any such looks to be a pig's ear when it comes to implementation, given past systems. As far as I know this is only in a consideration phase at the moment
That site is simply an exercise in the manipulation of statistics. For example, I could say that the temperature rise in the last half century has been about 0.2%, which actually equates to about 0.5 degrees kelvin, which is quite a substantial change. A change of 1% in the global temperature and we're talking significant change. I also don't buy the figures about human influence on CO2 in the atmosphere, the figures I've seen put current CO2 levels at almost 40% above the pre-industrial average, and while there are a lot of natural emisssions, we have killed off a lot of the capacity to absorb CO2 naturally, which is just as bad as releasing it directly.
Must be all those volcanos, flood basalts and meteorite impacts raising the temperature so.
Yes but for what reason? it is not enough to merely claim that the temperature is rising by natural causes - what causes? Increased solar luminosity? Decreased intersolar dust? Reduction in albedo? Massive volcanic emmisions? Temperatures dont just "rise" au naturel As far as I can see, the onus is upon the non anthropogenic crowd to find a suiatble cause for the rise in earthly temperature.
Since the global warming crowd isn't calling for a global reduction of green house gasses just in the US who has done more for the reduction of emissions than any other country. This would indicate that this is political science not actual science..  I'm sorry but this is XXXX. The US is the largest per capita emitter of CO2 in the world, so has to make the biggest cuts. All developed countries and some semi-developed countries are going to need to make cuts in emissions, and find non-polluting ways of developing. I'm not sure where this "done more than... any other country" thing comes from. How are you measuring that exactly?
Do you deny that the US has since the 70's have cut emissions by 90%.  I'm talking about CO2 emissions, what are you talking about? The US has most certainly not cut CO2 emissions since the 70s. It has cut levels of certain carcinogenic pollutants in vehicle and industry emissions, but so has every other western country that I'm aware of, and those emissions have naff all to do with climate change.  The problem with nuclear is that it is expensive, unsustainable and dangerous. Uranium is not all that common and the projections I've seen suggest that increased consumption could lead to uranium running low fairly quickly. Then we have to deal with the safe and secure disposal of substantial quantities of nuclear waste, which is not easy either. A much better approach is to pursue consistent forms of renewable energy, such as tidal and wave power, as well as enough of a surplus of wind and solar to offset the intermittency problems. Energy efficiency can also go a long way to cutting energy use - triple glazed windows, wall and roof insulation are all part of the solution, as is the switch to much more efficent electric vehicles.
Solar works great for water heating, I agree that it's not quite there for photo-voltaic cells currently. Wind is up and running well in most of Europe and expanding rapidly. Do you really think you're going to find it easier to get permission to build nuclear than wind? Over here we still remember the Chernobyl and Windscale problems.  I have heard of radon gas, it's pretty dangerous and you have to be careful in some older buildings over here because even the natural background can be pretty unhealthy if it is not vented properly.  Nuclear power is more expensive than wind per kilowatt, as I understand it, and given that no nuclear plants have been built here in decades, I doubt that this is due to the cost of building them.  What environmental impacts are you expecting from tidal power?
Do you deny that the earths atmosphere has changed temp. over the course of history?  No of course not. The global highstand of the cretaceous is attributed to the outgassing of Deccan traps, and a certain impact no doubt helped - but this is an example of where we know a reason why the global temp was high. There is no plausible explanation for the current trend other than human causes.   Cause and effect, very simple!
Even the nuclear industry's own estimates put costs at around 2.2-3.0p/kWh, compared to onshore wind turbines at 1.5-2.5p/kWh. Independent estimates put the cost of nuclear as high as 8.4p/kWh.
I like wind turbines, just put them along the side of motorways if you dislike them that much - who's going to notice more noise? You will find few environmentalists opposed to wind farms, scratch the surface of the opponents and you find nimby "conservationists" backed by pro-nuclear and other right wing organisations. Swaffham, in Norfolk seems to manage perfectly well with its turbine sited close to houses, last I checked they were building an extra one. In any case, I think wind turbines look rather better than the giant battery appearance of our local nuclear power station.  Yes, you need quite a lot of turbines, but they're cheap to make and relatively simple in construction, and not nearly as dangerous if they go wrong as nuclear plants (you still haven't mentioned Windscale I notice), and don't end up with hazardous waste being dumped in the sea (the amount of caesium you can find in morecambe bay is just scary).
Any links to accounts of increses solar luminosity or temperature?#   And when it comes to science that is being disputed, more than half of the time the majority is wrong. (the Earth is not flat, it is possible to go faster than the speed of sound, there are no WMD's etc  Science generally follows the evidence
I don't see how an 11 year solar cycle can account for the top ten hottest years on record all being since 1990. Nobody claims that climate change will mean each year will be hotter than the last, only that average temperatures will rise over time.  Also, did you miss these phrases in the telegraph article? He says that the increased solar brightness over the past 20 years has not been enough to cause the observed climate changes He added, however, that the study also showed that over the past 20 years the number of sunspots had remained roughly constant, while the Earth's temperature had continued to increase   The problem with using the torygraph as a source is that it mixes the views of scientists with the ramblings of the insane like David Bellamy, it's headlines and commentary bear no relation to the facts it is reporting. Nobody suggests that the sun has no effect, but to deny, as Bellamy does, that CO2 emissions are causing significant warming is frankly delusional.
If you want ALL the facts you'll be waiting till the end of time. The link between CO2 emissions and warming is a matter of basic quantum physics, it's not just a statistical link. We know that CO2 has an effect on warming. We can estimate the magnitude of that effect. The current modelling takes into account the other known factors, and the calculated effects of CO2 and matches the historical data pretty well. Certainly extrapolation can be a bit of a problem, but only if there is reason to believe the factors involved will alter substantially over the coming years.
There's a difference between all the facts and sufficient facts to draw a conclusion. I don't know ALL the facts necessary to work out how long it will take me to get to work, but I can make a fair approximation based on past experience and analysis of the situation. I won't know every possible detail of what might happen e.g. I might get hit by a bus, but most of the time my estimate will be fine.
I posted this over in the religion forum because of the religious implications, but this too seems like a good place to post it ...  Evangelical Leaders Join Global Warming Initiative   Among signers of the statement, which will be released in Washington on Wednesday, are the presidents of 39 evangelical colleges, leaders of aid groups and churches, like the Salvation Army, and pastors of megachurches, including Rick Warren, author of the best seller "The Purpose-Driven Life."  "For most of us, until recently this has not been treated as a pressing issue or major priority," the statement said. "Indeed, many of us have required considerable convincing before becoming persuaded that climate change is a real problem and that it ought to matter to us as Christians. But now we have seen and heard enough."  The statement calls for federal legislation that would require reductions in carbon dioxide emissions through "cost-effective, market-based mechanisms" - a phrase lifted from a Senate resolution last year and one that could appeal to evangelicals, who tend to be pro-business. The statement, to be announced in Washington, is only the first stage of an "Evangelical Climate Initiative" including television and radio spots in states with influential legislators, informational campaigns in churches, and educational events at Christian colleges.  http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/08/national/08warm.html?ex=1297054800&en=c3998565b07f9657&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss
Well, half a commitment is better than none at all I suppose, and better late than never.
I thought this was very clever.  http://today.uci.edu/news/release_detail.asp?key=1564  Scientists are tracking CO2 emissions using corn. They're taking corn from around the country and checking its carbon-14. "Natural" CO2 has a certain percentage of carbon-14, but CO2 from fossil fuels has none. By checking how far below the expected value the carbon-14 in a sample of corn is, they can tell how high the CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are in an area, and how the emissions spread. Clever.
http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/story.html?id=156df7e6-d490-41c9-8b1f-106fef8763c6&k=0 [INDENT][INDENT][I]"Dr. Shariv, a prolific researcher who has made a name for himself assessing the movements of two-billion-year-old meteorites, no longer accepts this logic, or subscribes to these views. He has recanted: "Like many others, I was personally sure that CO2 is the bad culprit in the story of global warming. But after carefully digging into the evidence, I realized that things are far more complicated than the story sold to us by many climate scientists or the stories regurgitated by the media.   I'm sorry, but is this really news? Shock! Horror! Hold the press! General public confused by large, complicated multifactoral systems.  I understand where this guy is coming from though, but not sure whether I agree with what he's doing, one of the huge drawbacks of modern democracy with the level of communications we have today is that most important decisions are made by people who don't really know anything about them. I don't doubt that climate behaviour is something that is far too complicated for anyone to totally understand and that to really get a grip on the subject you really need to dedicate some serious time to it. However just leaving every topic up to specialists brings a whole host of other problems with it.  Honestly I think the key to the problem lies more with the politicians, both sides (but particularly the right) will latch onto any bit of science that confirms what they want to believe and many won't even care whether or not it actually says what they want it to anyway. What you really want is some sort of sliding scale that adjusts the power of politicians based on how they use it - the more various studies and research is misrepresented, the more power is taken out of their hands, whilst if they are actually behaving like they should do they can have it back.  We're all working off ideals and systems of government that where devised when the best form of communication was a guy on a horse. Doesn't suprise for an instant that these systems might suddenly find themselves horribly flawed in these days of the mass market TV and internet. One of the critical issues today is man's impact on the changing environment and our fate is being governed by a group of people, half of whom are below average intellegence...  If one believes the hype, If global warming continues, coastal areas will flood and all the people who voted for Al Gore in 2000 or who were confused by a butterfly ballot would be under water.  What is the downside of Global Warming? If you go messing around with our gulf stream, a lot of us pinko commie Europeans are going to be coming to move in next door and force real football on you. That'll learn yer.
Climates change!  and cause extictions
The best plan is to run out of fossil fuels and die on the same day
Climate change is more complicated than rising CO2 levels??? Heresy!!!!! ;) Of course it's a complex issue. Duh! Doesn't get us off the hook that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and the earth is warming, and the warming appears to be accelerating.
A few scientist who are controlled by democratic parties say that.  Yet data shows otherwise. These increases in temps, melting of polar caps, during humans industrial age and suddenly increasing at its climax isn't due to natural changes, you have to be blind to think so.  What made me laugh are a few non-caring individuals who attempted to use the Polar Vortex as an example, but failed to see a link. THe vortex itself has even slightly changed due to changes in flow aroudn the world, THe natural depletion increased from 5% to 8%.  However this is a strong natural accurance. In the opposite pole however, the much higher effect is not natural. Corporate greed will dispel it. They need to sell those fossil fuels. Ther are 4 scientific groups, both owned by corporations who distribute fossil fuels, their opimion is blinding the world further.  Ice that has exsisted for 126 million years has disapeared. Other ice cored and dated that is over 50 million years old is almost gone. Yes ice that is much newer is over it, but hte core samples have existed on this planet for so long, and durign the climax of emmisions has disapeared. Yet we have no affect on that?  Here is the thing. It's to late to fix it ourselves, and we have to deal with that. SLowing or stoppign it is possible. At that point mother earth will have to correct it herself. However we continue beign ignorant, humanity may not be in the equation at all.  Decreased forest, increased C02. SAying it isn't linked means greed is envolved or you are not capable of seeing the obvious answers. The majority of the INDEPENDENT scientist still agree, it is related to industry and man, and is a real issue.
The height of the spring tide in Liverpool bay is 7 inches higher now than previously recorded. If you think CO2 is not a factor how do you explain Venus?
The UN report was released today I think.
but lets not bury our heads in the sand. Surely conservation of our natural resources is agood idea? Waste not, want not.
Yeah and the sulfuric acid might affect it a little too. Meanwhile back here on Earth, the weather reports in the North East are predicting it will be colder on Easter Sunday than it was on Christmas day. We got 10 inches of snow 2 days ago and it's been in the 20s ever since. This isn't global warming folks, it's the last days of this Age. And the weather is going to get more unpredictable, Volcanoes and Earthquakes will continue to increase, and natural catastrophes and pestilence such as never been seen before will take place, and then the end will come. So, welcome to the end of the Age folks. :) Our redemption draweth nigh.    Good to be grounded by reality, eh?
Except that I can see the holes in his argument, for example the supposed "discrepancies" before 1976 when the earth cooled slightly HAVE been explained, not least by the effect of air pollution.
Who says it's the same pollutants? I'm talking about things like sulphur released from burning high sulphur content coal, which leads to both cooling and acid rain. The clean air legislation in western countries did a lot to reduce this sort of pollution, but little to combat CO2 emissions.
Just because he's not biased doesn't mean he's not wrong.
That does little to indict the article. This man is pretty well respected in his field.  No he isn't. He's generally regarded as a maverick and a conspiracy theorist. But that's not a reason to disregard his work, it's a reverse argument from authority.  He once offered to bet any other climatologist that temperatures would lower in the next 20 years. When Dr. James Annan offered to take the bet, Lindzen said it would be at 50:1 in his own favour. Obviously Annan didn't take it.  No...Lindzen often complains that funding for anti-anthropocentric global warming research is drying up due to a huge conspiracy in the scientific and commercial sectors. It's not. It's drying up because most of science found that the anthropocentric nature of global warming was overwhelmingly likely by the beginning of this decade.  Incidentally, I'm baffled by the line of thought that is willing to take Lindzen at his word but discounts the vast majority of scientists who say that global warming IS caused by man. Why accept one view and not the other?
People will tend to hear what they want to hear, part of human nature. If they aren't scientifically trained and/or haven't been keeping up with the research as it comes in they can come off with scewed interpretations of what's being said.
He is a professor of meterology, however, not of climatology. The fact that he is at MIT is largely irrelevant when he speaks outside his area of expertise. The bet is fairly well known, though I hadn't connected it with this particular scientist. The blog from which the issue arose appears to be here: http://www.reason.com/news/show/34976.html
I tend to give credance to a professor at MIT.  Very brave of you to come right out and say that. I normally give credence to strong theory backed up by solid facts, but horses for courses and all that.  May I ask, is it just MIT, or are there other universities whose word you might take?
Many people are obliged to take a great deal on trust - which is why a professor at a highly respected (i.e. trustworthy) institution such as MIT is likely to get a deferential hearing from the media and general public.  Well quite. But then again majority concensus is that global warming is [at least in part] man-made. The trouble is that dissenting views are so much more interesting so they get an unequal share of the spotlight. It makes it look like there's significant doubt that GW is man-made. There really isn't.   Arguably if people are just taking these things on trust and not actually evaluating sources, they shouldn't be debating the subject in the first place.
A consensus isn't necessarily correct. There used to be a majority consensus (among the educated) that earth was at the centre of the universe.  But that was an assumed consensus rather than one that was scientifically arrived at (indeed when it was scientifically approached by Aristarchus in the 3rd century BC he did grasp the fact that our solar system was heliocentric at the very least - a point that became consensus amongst the educated and beliefs in geocentricity were very much more popular amongst the uneducated). With the scientific tools we have now (and the use of independent work from different disciplines) consensus is a different animal.   What you're demanding here would exclude the "average person" from having an opinion about almost anything outside his personal experience.  I'm not demanding anything. I would say that one should be in possession of the facts before forming an opinion though. That seems self-evident.   Nearly all of our knowledge is "second-hand". We must rely on the expertise of specialists not only for scientific information but for accurate information about almost everything else. How many people who know something about political history have consulted Magna Carta in the Latin original?  There's a difference between second hand knowledge and just 'taking their word for it'. Since Lindzen is regarded as a bit of a quack by much of his profession, I submit that it's even more important to check his "facts" rather than submitting to authority.
The Ptolemaic consensus could be described as resulting from the best "science" available during the period of its credibility. But my point was meant to express a sceptical attitude towards consensus whether ancient or modern.  Indeed. But I think it's fair to draw a distinction between a consensus largely drawn from philosophy (that the Universe is neater if we're at the centre) and that of the scientific method.    What does it mean to "possess" a fact? Does it mean that by personal investigation one has acquired certain knowledge that such and such is the case? Or does it mean that - particularly in fields of scientific inquiry - one has reason to believe the facts as presented by some authority or other? I suggest that we cannot avoid deferring to an authority to vouch for the reliability of many facts about matters which we cannot verify for ourselves.  Well that's the burning question isn't it? I'll tell you what it doesn't mean. It doesn't mean picking the one maverick scientist whose claims support your prejudices.     I don't know whether you are correct when you say that Lindzen is regarded as a "quack". Are you claiming that he has invented some "facts" to suit his case, or that he has the same objective information about the climate as other scientists, but has interpreted it in a way that affronts the consensus?  Even his one time co-author Daniel Kirk-Davidoff has spent his time rebutting Lindzen. Lindzen doesn't deal much in facts anymore, he deals in unfounded claims that his maverick stance has resulted in his funding being cut in an effort to silence him. In fact it's been cut because his field of study is about as much use as a chocolate fire-guard.
Ptolemy's system was a mathematical structure that was observationally adequate as late as the 16th century and not much more complex than the Copernican successor.  I'm not convinced it represented a consensus (except inasmuch as his system was usable by early navigators) since the likes of Heraclides, Aristarchus, Archimedes and Martianus Capella all "knew" the Earth rotated the sun. However, it's not an important enough point to labour. Today's consensus comes from independent study by FAR more scientists, using FAR better equipment.   Scientific progress often depends on the maverick or nay-sayers who challenge a prevailing consensus. Without such dissenters science would stagnate. I don't know enough about Lindzen's hypotheses to rebut your assurance that he doesn't deal in facts anymore. Perhaps Huck - who cited him in the first place - does. In any case, I don't think he's the "one maverick scientist whose claims support my prejudices".  I wasn't implying he supported your prejudices (a word I use under advisement - it isn't meant to be insulting) but rather that he is handy for global warming deniers (except that he comes across as a bitter academic who chose the wrong avenue to work down and is now digging his heels in rather than recant).  Why do you describe a sceptical view of (unqualified) anthropogenic global warming as a "prejudice"? I assume you're aware that the current orthodoxy on climate change is itself a provisional conjecture.  Conjecture? Depends on your definition. This http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/02/news/climate.php?page=1 suggests that's not such a sketchy thing to be. You'll note Susan Solomon saying that the connection between man and GW is now considered 90% likely (up from 66%). I don't know about you, but for me that's a big enough percentage to start acting as if it were reality not conjecture. Sure, they still may be wrong, but that's not a bet I'm willing to make.*  *It also suggests there's something fishy about your figures of more than half of European, Australasian and Asian thinking the likes of Lindzen are right. Europe has long been attempting to be far more "green" than the US - New Zealand has long been succeeding (don't know if you've been there - beautiful country; very keen on the renewable resources).  You'll have to wait until tomorrow for a dissection of Lindzen. It'll be time-consuming and very dull (to read and to write).
[As promised - a little rushed I'm afraid as I don't have much time today. It gives a flavour at least, I think (and I managed to keep it short!).]  That "various models" [unspecified] predict something, other than what has happened, is a strawman. Apart from anything else, the variables involved make it difficult to be more specific than 'the trend is towards warming'. The sea, for instance, acts as a huge heat sink. But the main reason why predictions are so mercurial is that we can't account for cloud formation and cover. Either way, gathering all models together and then claiming that there are discrepancies is sleight-of-hand, Tommy Cooper style.  Cooling period 1940's - 70's - one would have to be willfully ignoring the facts not to note that this period represented a huge production of sulphate aerosols. The various clean air acts and better technology brought in to combat acid rain have lowered sulphate aerosol presence in the atmosphere - a presence which causes cooling.  The idea that warming won't be catastrophic simply boggles the mind! May you'll be alright, Jack, but what of sub-Saharan Africa?! Central Asia?! What, indeed, of the rise in sea-level? The loss of agricultural land? Most importantly, the loss of fresh water? Who in their right mind would take this gamble?
I've already explained that in this thread. The earth absorbs radiation in a broad spectrum from the sun, but because of the quantised nature of energy levels in atoms and molecules it is emitted in a much narrower range of frequencies. These frequencies coincide with those most readily absorbed by the "greenhouse" gases (different gases "block" different parts of the spectrum) and hence the radiation cannot escape as easily as it got in.
The atmosphere allows high frequency radiation (violet end) through, this is absorbed by the earth which then radiates in low frequency (red end) wavelengths. It is these that get caught in the CO2 etc.
all this global warming garbage is just a bunch of political propaganda. global warming is just an excuse for the liberals to raise taxes on the people.  It's so annoying that Rush Limbaugh would be so preposterous, and with such strong conviction.   I always thought that having independent thought was a healthy lifestyle.
I always thought that having independent thought was a healthy lifestyle.  Only if it's not independent from reality...
Only if it's not independent from reality...  Eh, based on our government, reality necessitates that we conform to what our government wants, which doesn't require so much independent thought, else we would figure out how they are shaping the laws into their own set of rules. Unfortunately, it appears that there's not much we can do, since the government has reduced the effective role of the EPA while polluting companies are continuing at full speed.   My only disturbance is that the previous comment was simply a grouping of ideas shared on radio talk shows (global warming garbage....propaganda....liberals...raising taxes). That person wouldn't have thought it originally had it not been for conformists talking into their ears on a regular basis.
Global warming...natural climate change...insignificant issues compared to our destruction of habitat. Deforestation in virgin rain forests is removing bees, the males of which must visit a certain orchid before the females will allow them to mate. The nectar or pollen (of a certain species of orchid) or both must be on the bee's knees before the female will get it on.  We're cutting down the trees, the bees are disappearing, the Brazil nut trees are going unpollenated, producing no nuts...just because the bees can't find the orchids.  God forbid we should kill off all the hippos. Life in the rivers would be devastated.
Fact: we have lost ice glaciers nad caps that are more then 120 million years old, they aer gone.  Iceland is not the issue, greenland has not recovered.  Polar bears are threatened due to the hudeg loss in ice that is not reversing itself.  Tempurtures continue to rise on a mean level, and are not reversing.  FOr the ice lost to reform, it will not be in the next 20 generations.  Political driven scientist lie. 20 scientists have been caught for being hired by fossil fuel producers to produce false report.
I'd like to see a link for the sun being hotter causing warming on mars, because from what I've read the warming is due to changes in albedo (basically how reflective the surface is) which mean mars is absorbing more radiation now than it was previously. These changes fluctuate over time as different types if dust are redistributed on the surface.
So, the claim is solely based on the fact that both Earth and Mars are warming, rather than any causative evidence (like, for example, some evidence of an increase in solar radiation)? I'm also puzzled by the assertion that the greenhouse effect has no scientific basis, I'd like to see Habibullo Abdussamatov's new version of quantum theory that apparently contradicts it. Apart from anything else the greenhouse effect is a big part of the reason Earth is so much warmer than mars in the first place, and why Venus is so much hotter than earth (distance from the sun is a factor but heat retention, not application, is the biggie here). There is also no explanation as to why CO2 levels have risen in line with industrial development, and occurred before temperatures started to rise. Abdussamatov is an astronomer who no apparent clue about climatology, or even basic quantum physics.
I think there was something about the frequency of sunspots and warming. Like the more spots means more heat. I'll search.  Traditionally you don't do science by reaching a conclusion and then googling til you come up with the requisite answer...  The Earth is definitely warming. Mars *may* be warming. Or it might be a localised effect. Venus already experienced a runaway global warm due to - guess what - a large amount of CO2 in its atmosphere. Mars has a thin atmosphere but its mostly made of CO2. What does this suggest? That if you increase CO2 in the atmosphere, you get a warming effect. What does this suggest to me? That pouring CO2 into the atmosphere is a bad idea.  If the sun was causing this warm up we'd expect the rest of the planets to be warming too (and our own moon). You say they are. Where's the evidence?
Here's a link that shows that other planets are warming up too:  http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread221608/pg1  From the linked article re Pluto: David Tholen, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii who measured the size of Pluto in the late 1980s using a series of occultations and eclipses involving Pluto's satellite, noted that even though Pluto was closest to the sun in 1989, a warming trend 13 years later shouldn't be unexpected. "It takes time for materials to warm up and cool off, which is why the hottest part of the day on Earth is usually around 2 or 3 p.m. rather than local noon, when sunlight is the most intense," Tholen said. Because Pluto's year is equal to about 250 Earth years, 13 years after Pluto's closest approach to the Sun is like 1:15 p.m. on Earth. "This warming trend on Pluto could easily last for another 13 years," Tholen estimated.  Which makes more sense given that Pluto is so far from the sun and yet seems to be warming more quickly than the planets closer in.  BTW if CO2 causes global warming, why did the Earth cool off in the period between 1940 and 1980 eventhough the CO2 output went through the roof?  The usual explanation is that we were pouring sulphur-based chemicals into the air in those days. As we often see from volcanoes, this causes a cooling effect.
While what you guys say is true about Earth going through phases, it should not be happening this quickly. True, Mars is heating up, but don't forget that the Martian Atmosphere is 78% CO2, and so the slightest raise in temperature emitted by the sun will have a huge effect, much bigger then here on earth.
A long-term increase in solar irradiance is heating both Earth and Mars. While CO2 gasses may have contributed to global warming, it is not the main factor.  Evidence for this?
Is there any difference between global warming denial and creationism? Both groups seem to think their opinion trumps that of the actual experts in the field and the generally held opinion of the scientific community. Both cherry pick scientific papers to match their opinion. There is no real difference...
All new consensus in science arise for challenging the opinions of experts in the field, if you want to remove that, you can say goodbye to any new findings in science.  Generally those challenges come from other scientists not from random punters on a message board touting opinion as it if it had any bearing on reality. What puzzles me is why non-climatologists would take a position contrary to the mainstream. Surely the best you could say is "I have no opinion"? Actually stating that you think the majority of climatologists are incompetent seems rather arrogant...
a) to label designers of hypothetical mathematical computer models (i.e. computer programmers) as "climatologists" and  What?  b) to somehow think that the same people who can't even accurately predict the weather for the next 2 weeks can predict the weather for the next 50 years and  Unless point 1 was intended to mean you don't believe climatologists exist (a point that your link refutes) then I think you may have meteorologists and climatologists confused. They don't even study the same thing.  c) to think that the majority is always right. I myself would settle for quality over quantity any day.  And how do you judge the quality of your list of climate luminaries...which includes TV personality David Bellamy...  These days it seems that anybody who isn't towing the party line about global warming is labelled and treated in the same way as some who questions certain aspects of the Holocaust. Genuine debate isn't appreciated and the only thing that we are left with is emotionally laden soundbites.  The last sentence is dripping with irony given that you invoke Godwin's Law in the preceding one. Is that genuine debate? Or is it an emotionally-laden soundbite?  you would know that the entire aspect of the possibility of the suns influence on our climate has been completely ignored.  Yeah, that's getting down to the facts alright.emoticon_rolleyes  How do you know it's been ignored.  All of which ignores my point which was that - at the risk of argument from authority - on what basis are we arguing this? Are we better equipped than the scientists? Do we really have any option but to take their word for it given that they are the *experts*?
A long-term increase in solar irradiance is heating both Earth and Mars. While CO2 gasses may have contributed to global warming, it is not the main factor.  Really?  http://www.architecture2030.org/images/current_situation/CS02-CO2-Temperature.gif
If you're unqualified to disagree with scientific findings, you're not qualified to agree with them either.  Which is why I said the default should be 'I have no opinion'...except that's not really an option in this case.  Incidentally the reason I reject creationism isn't because I have blind faith in majorities of scientists, but because their arguments are specious and available information doesn't support their position.  ...Which is quite easy to make out because the creationists have a few crackpots not doing real science, whereas the scientists are legion and do good research. How many other fields of mainstream science do you support a minority view of?   I find many of the arguments of the prophets of global warming specious too. They roughly amount to.  a) We should accept scientific consensus about global warming, because we aren't qualified to challenge it. Therefore global warming is true.  b) Because global warming is true, any scientist who challenges it is a crackpot or corrupt.  Prophets? We're talking about the scientists, not the likes of Al Gore. I'm not inclined to listen to non-experts as I'v already mad clear.  So what do we have, unquestioning faith in a belief system that we won't question ourselves or allow scientists to question without labelling them as moral or intellectual degenerates.  I have no problem with them questioning. I believe it was mentioned in the UN report that it was 90% (or thereabouts) certain that GW was man-made, so there remains room for error. Trouble is, of course, that, because we have only one planet, the stakes are rather high to gamble with uncertainties.   Are you aware that the historical record shows the temperature rise occurring ~800 years PRIOR to the increase in CO2, indicating that it is not CO2 which is the cause of temperature change historically, but rather that temperature change is the cause of CO2 being released? Correlation does not equal causation, especially when the cause is occurring 800 years after its effect. But of course, I'm not a climate scientist, so let's just ignore the facts and instead buy into consensus as the sole arbiter of truth, swallowing whatever lies Al Gore wants to broadcast in the process.  You can't possibly think that climate scientists missed this?! CO2 in the atmosphere is a positive feedback system. What you have stated does NOT indicate that CO2 is not the cause of temperature change. Moreso it indicates that CO2 is not THE cause. There are several.  The salient points are that we are experiencing the hottest temperatures for 10,000 years AND that this warming has happened faster than at any other time in history that we can make out. The *fact* that human-produced CO2 was having some kind of noteable effect was known in 1938 - before worldwide industrialization really kicked off *and* during the time when we were still pumping sulphur-based chemicals into the atmosphere (which aided in negating warming). These effects have become *so* noticeable that even the politicians are sitting up and taking notice (and possibly even taking steps that could potentially harm our economies).  The question remains, if you think that CO2 *doesn't* cause warming (as well as being produced by it), what mechanism prevents it from doing so?
I was talking about scientists in general. These are the same guys that 30 years ago were convinced that we were going to have global cooling. And now 30 years later, which is basically 1 second later in Earth terms, the scientific community has done a 180.  A number of points spring to mind. Firstly, which scientists are you talking about? GW has been known about since the 19th century. Secondly, there was still widespread use of suplhur-based chemicals 30 years ago which DID cause cooling. Thirdly, whilst on the one hand people are talking about how ideas get turned over, in science, for better ones when better data and more accurate equipment becomes available, we seem to be exempting GW from the same courtesy.  They use computer simulations to study climate change, but these computer models rely on an incredible amount of variables and I'm not convinced in any way that they managed to get all the variables right.  Why are you not convinced? Do you have some evidence that these people don't know what they're doing? It might well be quite complicated to work out *exactly* what's going to happen but doesn't it just stand to reason that pumping vast amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere would raise the temperature? Otherwise, what's your proposed mechanism for it not doing so?  I don't put that much faith in Mankinds ability to predict the future. I think it's rather arrogant to think that the human race has somehow figured out how our entire eco-system works. Especially considering the almost infinite number of variables that are involved. Contrary to popular belief, we are not the masters of the universe.  Arrogant? Is it arrogant to think we might know what happened fractions of seconds after the Big Bang? Or what goes on in the heart of a star? Or to model how things work at sub-atomic levels? Calling it arrogance is a weird sort of ad hominem against the whole of science.  Oh I agree that some of them are ####, but a lot of them are not.  Well there aren't 'a lot of them'. I also have a working hypothesis that if one has to scrabble around to find "experts" to the extent of including honorary professors, mathematicians and (God help us!) engineers, that list is unlikely to be worth the bandwidth it's written on.   And in my opinion if there is doubt amongst these people, then the phenomenon of global warming must be researched more thoroughly instead of just saying that it's a done deal.  And you speak of arrogance?! Just when would you be satisified?  Is it now forbidden to compare anything to what happened during WWII because of said law? Does even mentioning Godwin's Law automatically close off the debate?  Merely pointing out the irony.  Well the catalyst for bringing global warming to the mainstream was the UN report.  No it wasn't. Unless you've been living in a cave, we've been talking about global warming in the mainstream since at least the '80's.   This report was touted as the most comprehensive study ever done on global warming. But surprise, surprise, the report didn't mention the suns influence on the Earth, past and present, at all. Now how can a report that is supposed to be "the most comprehensive study ever" not include the effect of a big flaming ball of nuclear fusion on the Earth? The answer is of course that this information was omitted because it didn't tow the party line of manmade global warming.  Possibly because we've known about that for about 150 years. The sun's effect in the way you're talking about runs in 21,000 year cycles - the warming we're seeing is far to quick to be its result.  First of all, I question everything, especially things that are being said by the government and their "experts". I don't fall for the dogma that the government knows best. When I look at all of human history, I rarely find a case where the government did something that was in the best interests of the people. Government is all about control. And people that are afraid are easy to control. Just give them something to be scared about (like terrorism or global warming) and tell the sheeple that the government will protect them, because the government knows best.  Now we get to the crux of the matter. My own theory for why people question GW is *because* government has suddenly got involved. Immediately our authority aversion kicks in and we shy away from what governent believes. But that doesn't make sense. Scientists have been trying (with little success) since the '80's to get governments to take the GW threat seriously. Now, when the evidence points so firmly towards the manmade cause, they are finally doing so.  Secondly, even the rigged UN report says that there is a 90% chance that global warming is man made. So basically that leaves a 10% chance that it isn't man made.  You play those odds? Good luck. I wouldn't take them on a horse race let alone the fate of our only home.
Climate scientists are the ones who discovered this, about 5 years ago. The same climate scientists who are increasingly skeptical of global warming claims.  I studied those positive feedback systems in A-level geography about 15 years ago. I know of at least one article from 10 years ago (Terrestrial Ecosystem Feedbacks to Global Climate Change - Lashof et al - Annual Review of Energy and the Environment, 1997 edition, volume 22) that talks about this AND is talking about how it is a potentially catastrophic result of man's activities. They aren't new.   So far I've seen a short list of people who dispute GW - even shorter if you take out the non-climatologists...and I've seen you, Symbiote, debate creationists before and I'm pretty sure you wouldn't accept that from them...  But of course the Global Warming propaganda machine didn't get the message, since they only rebroadcast information, even false information, that suits their message. It was well known before Al Gore lied about it in his documentary, and it was well known before unriggable rebroadcast it.  I haven't seen Al Gore's film, so I can't comment. I pay little notice of lay-people who talk about GW.  So its arrogant to disagree with the "mainstream", because we're not qualified, but you think you are qualified to agree with the "mainstream". Are you trying to be ironic or is insulting anyone who disagrees with the global warming "consensus" all you have to support it?  Seems to me that I laid out quite a lot of support for GW. Doesn't it make more sense to go with the mainstream until you have something conclusive that goes against if? If I visit my doctor and (God forbid) he tells me I have HIV, I don't debate with him about whether it will turn into AIDS as some fringe researchers have done.  I'm not sure that I've insulted anybody. I asked what other mainstream theories do you dispute and why?
I'm talking about the scientific community at large. Newsweek and TIME magazine both did articles about it. And as for you sulfur argument, I suggest you look at the current industrial powerhouses India and China and see how much sulfur they still spew into the atmosphere. According to your logic the Earth should still be cooling because of it.  Your final paragraph states that it was recently snowing in Sweden. Presumably you wished to show that this was evidence against GW. It just happens that the prevailing wind out of the Russian industrial heartlands blows right over northern Europe. Incidentally India and China still don't have the West's industrial output. We may yet see another cooling effect.  I suggest that we first take a more in depth look at the suns influence on the Earths climate before we start levying eco-taxes and start to take away more of peoples rights.  Why? We've been doing that for over 100 years. The 'Establishment' is saying that pretty shortly it's going to be too late.  And what 'rights' are you talking about?  So if I question one part of science I question all of it? Talk about disingenious debate...  Why is it disingenuous. I've yet to get a sensible answer on why you believe one set of scientists and not another.  Has it ever occurred to you that the vast majority of scientists get funding from the government and as such have a conflict of interest with regards to politicized science?  Global conspiracy? Really? We're talking about faking results here. On a grand scale.   I'll be satisfied when parties on both sides of the argument can be heard without one party being ridiculed by the other. Anybody who makes up their mind without hearing both sides of the argument is a fool.  Why? That's what academia's like. Besides which, for those of us who accept that MMGW is going on, the stubborn refusal of others to accept it may very well cost us our planet. You want us to be reasonable? Why?!  And what did we do about it in the 80's and 90's? Nothing. Only around the same time that UN report was released (give or take a few years) did national governments really start to act (Kyoto was a farce) and did the global warming movement get into high gear. These days it's all about CO2 (taxes), global warming, eco this, eco that, and of course my favourite, carbon trading. 5 Years ago that wasn't the case.  And you don't think that this might be down increased pressure *on* governments *by* researchers and down to the data pointing *so* strongly to a man-made cause that governments have *had* to pay attention? Just what would a government U-turn in the face of overwhelming evidence look like if not this?  Actually the suns has many cycles, the most common one being the 10-11 years cycle.  We know.  And if you want quick warming how about 10.000 years ago when the Earths temperature rose 6 degrees Celsius in a decade.  Out of sincere interest, what's the source? I'd be interested to know why.  And in the 70's they were convinced it was global cooling. So in the space of 5-10 years they do a complete 180. Yeah that'll instill my confidence in them.  WHO was?  BTW it was snowing in Stockholm recently. Imagine that, snow in the spring. That's warming alright.  I guess it still hasn't dawned on people that the Earth is still in the process of coming about of a bloody ice age.  You think it hasn't dawned on climatologists that we've just come out of an ice age? Really? And yet you saw it straight away?  GW doesn't predict a straight warming. The Earth has many systems to realign. It's the overall trend climatologists look at. Meteorologists would be more interested in your short term anomalies.
You're talking about something entirely different, how can the relationship between CO2 and Temperature hundreds of thousands of years ago be a "potentially catastrophic result of man's activities". I don't think you understand at all what the chart unriggable posted shows, and what it is supposed to show. This relationship wasn't known until ~5 years ago, so it certainly wasn't in your high school geography lessons.  I'm not debating that CO2 and temperature aren't linked in the way you state. I'm saying that pouring more CO2 into the system is going to shift temperature. Given that graph is graduated in 50,000's of years it's a little difficult to see what the current effect is. The UN report says it's going higher and faster than ever. I'm not quite sure which part of the correlation you're suggesting wasn't known about until 5 years ago. We've known about CO2 fluctuations for decades. I've referenced a paper from 10 years ago discussing man's input.   No, you're right, I don't accept a list of people who support something as an argument for it. Apparently you do, you think you should "go with the mainstream" and ignore alternative views while calling anyone who disagrees "arrogant", because this approach of blind faith in a majority of scientists is truly enlightened.  I'm not talking about ignoring alternative views. The mainstream (pretty much by definition I guess) has more data supporting it hence I (tentatively) accept it. Not to mention that the people who do the research have a much wider view on the subject than I do. If someone came and told me I was doing my job incompetently, I'd want to know their credentials for saying so. What puzzles me (as I've asked you twice) is what other fringe views do you follow with such zeal?
Yes, you're saying that, but it's now known that the historical relationship doesn't show that. You really don't know whether jamming more CO2 in would affect temperature significantly at all, certainly in the amounts we're talking about reducing by imposing various emission standards and credit trading schemes.  Given the properties of CO2, the question has to be, how could it NOT raise the temperature? Where's it going to go?  The fact that historical CO2 trends follow historical temperature trends rather than lead them.  These aren't mere fluctuations, they are extremely large shifts in atmospheric CO2 concentrations mapping onto prior changes in temperature.  The 'fact'? Dr Naomi Oreskes of the University of California San Diego famously searched the Institute for Scientific Information's archives (1993 - 2003) for papers that dissented from the MMGW line...and found none. If such data exists, why isn't it being published?  Furthermore, what's your mechanism for higher CO2 production? This'll be the kicker won't it? Why is it getting warmer? AFAIK when it happened in the Jurassic, it is supposed that large scale release of methane was the cause.   It doesn't have more data supporting it, and you already claimed you were unqualified to understand or interpret the data, and that to do so would be arrogant.  (see above)   You don't accept it because you have considered the data, you accept it because a) You believe blindly following majority opinion is the way to the Truth, and that the problem with Creationism isn't its faulty reasoning, its the failure to accept majoritarian science.  b) You believe that the risks of disbelieving global warming are high, and the benefits of disbelieving it few.  Argumentum ad clairvoyance?  It's only now you've even mentioned considering the data. Certainly you haven't even considered your views in light of this data about global warming across the rest of the solar system.  I discussed that earlier on in the thread I believe - I aksed whether there was data for ALL of the planets. I'd also question why there would be global warming across the rest of the solar system when solar output hasn't increased: http://www.mps.mpg.de/images/projekte/sun-climate/climate_l.gif  What's your point? I don't have an ideology of "Follow mainstream views" or "reject mainstream views", I like to see some kind of logical argument for a conclusion.  My question is, given the dearth of data (or possibly research) supporting your position, why do you hold it.   Actually here's one: The idea of "sunlight is bad for you, you should avoid it as much as possible", there's some interesting research in that area going on too. But of course, if we go by the "if the majority of scientists don't believe in it, those who do are 'fringe cranks' theory of knowledge", we shouldn't even bother considering such views.  This rather beautifully illustrates my hunch. I would imagine that scientists would say that sunlight is necessary for the proper synthesis of vitamin D. They might also say that it aids in combatting depression. They might further say, don't stay out in it for too long because the UV will cause damage. All of these points are correct. It's not scientists that say 'sunlight bad', it's the media who chop it up into manageable (and generally innaccurate) chunks. I think it's the media that has presented the GW debate as if there was any real dissent in the scientific community - they've done exactly what the Discovery Institute and its ilk have done with the evo/creo debate.
Yes, the fact. The historical trend of CO2 following changes in temperature is now well established. How is it that you are concerned with the "data" but haven't even heard of this? Oh wait, its because you don't think you need data, since its arrogant to look at the facts yourself, better instead to rely on consensus.    It is published, you just haven't heard of it before now, because it doesn't support the MMGW position.    Given the complexity of the climate system, how could you predict with any confidence that proposed restrictions on CO2 output would change the rate of climate change sufficiently enough to justify their costs. We're talking about obscene amounts of money, enough perhaps to cure AIDS, cancer, to develop the third world, but instead the imperative is to manipulate CO2 output in some way when it is unclear this manipulation will have much an effect at all.    That you aren't aware of published data doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  I'm sure you can link to, say, 2-3 articles in peer reviewed journals about the topic then, seeing as it is so well known.  Why do you continue to ignore the causal link between CO2 in the atmosphere and increases in average temperature? We're not only talking a statistical link, but one with a known cause and effect. Do you simply not understand quantum theory?
Quantum theory will tell you how much warming CO2 will produce, and my understanding is that this forms part of the climate models. Costing and quantifying reductions in carbon emissions is perfectly possible. Obviously there are different methods of doing this and we could argue over which ones to use, but the costs of, for example, wind power are quite well quantified, the energy payback is less than a year, the cost works out a bit more expensive than gas or coal but cheaper than nuclear.  The journal article you linked to appears to refer to a single period a quarter of a million years ago and to the end of an ice age, it also points to a lag of 600-1000 years, so unless you want to associate the current CO2 level rise (which is far higher than that referenced in the article) with the mediaeval warm period you're not making a lot of sense.
Without going and looking up the figures for the energy levels of a CO2 molecule, and how many CO2 molecules there are in the atmosphere, and factoring in the curvature of the earth (plus a few hundred other variables) I can't provide an exact figure. That's why we pay research climatologists to build models, because it's complex. You were claiming that warming precedes CO2 release. You've provided one instance, a situation completely different to the present day, and no reason to suppose that this is the orientation of cause and effect in the current climate, which was very much what you implied previously  I don't recall specifying any cost in lives, I fail to see how getting power from renewable sources instead of fossil fuels need cost any lives. There is no need to stop all carbon emissions, just make sure that they come from renewable sources. Rampant global warming, however, has the potential to cost millions of lives through consequent flooding, famine and disease. If you want to be utilitarian about it, the balance should be struck when inaction will cause more deaths than action.  I don't know why you feel the need to attack this strawman enivronmentalism that demands a return to the stone age. Wind, wave, solar and tidal power have the potential to sustain modern technology and standards of living, as well as support the development of poorer countries. And since when did Mr. Free Market become concerned about the developing world?
Err... the models DO accurately model the historical data.  And being in favour of the free market either means you are chronically deluded or you don't care about poor people. Which is it?
They're not meterological models, why on earth should they tell you the weather?
Huh? If you knew, why write the first paragraph? Or are you saying that short term solar cycles don't matter? Maybe because they poke a hole in the man made global warming hoax?  Eh? You don't think that the fact that we have accurate temperature records for the last 150 years or so which DON'T show the kind of temperature you're looking for, rather pokes a hole in *your* theory?  In case you haven't noticed, China and India have the majority of the worlds manufacturing capability. Look around the room you're in, I guarantee you that 75% of all the stuff that's in there is manufactured in those countries. China just surpassed the US as the country with the largest CO2 output in the world.  And if China's and India's sulfur output causes another cooling effect, then we're not experiencing global warming, are we?  Two points: 1) China has indeed (based on estimates) passed the US in CO2 production. In case *you* hadn't noticed, the US doesn't make up the whole of 'the west'. But China and India are indeed churning out a lot of sulphurous gas. This is not a good thing. It's rather toxic and causes acid rain. Chances are they'll start using cleaner technology when people start keeling over dead and their water supplies are fouled. 2) Global warming is not a homogenous effect. The really worrying warming is that which happens at the poles. Some parts of the globe may well experience cooling even disregrading the effects of smog clouds.
Yes, the fact. The historical trend of CO2 following changes in temperature is now well established.  The fact that it's a positive feedback system is well established.   Oh wait, its because you don't think you need data, since its arrogant to look at the facts yourself, better instead to rely on consensus.  Have a word with yourself. It's arrogant to think that you know better than professional scientists. It's arrogant to think that your Googling somehow trumps their research.  It is published, you just haven't heard of it before now, because it doesn't support the MMGW position.  Okay. And why hasn't anyone else heard of it?  Given the complexity of the climate system, how could you predict with any confidence that proposed restrictions on CO2 output would change the rate of climate change sufficiently enough to justify their costs. We're talking about obscene amounts of money, enough perhaps to cure AIDS, cancer, to develop the third world, but instead the imperative is to manipulate CO2 output in some way when it is unclear this manipulation will have much an effect at all.  You mean all that money we were using to save the world *before* we knew there was a problem with the climate? The fact that *you're* unsure that the measures being taken will have any effect, or are even important, frankly doesn't carry any weight over here.   That you aren't aware of published data doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  Invisible pink unicorns spring to mind.  ABE: I'd also suggest that arguing that the measures we take to combat global warming being the cause of widespread death in the developing world are something of a red herring. Given that Global Warming is unequivocally happening, if we *aren't* the cause of it, then we're pretty much screwed anyway. Sub-Saharan Africa seems unlikely to be able to support much in the way of Agriculture, Bangladesh will be underwater...in fact I'd envision the equatorial regions would be pretty unpleasant to live in.
Professional scientists are the ones who discovered this information.  Discovered that temperature is driving CO2 production? Isn't this the kind of blatantly obvious bit of data that *nobody* could miss?  Plenty of people have heard of it. You and Al Gore don't constitute a representative sample.  Sorry, I wasn't clear. I meant 'within the scientific mainstream', not amongst 'people who wish it wasn't happening'.  I don't expect it to, since you've already explained you believe in majoritarianism rather than reason.  I believe creationism is false because it is illogical, you believe it is false because it is unpopular among scientists.  Nah, by creationism's lights it's perfectly logical. God can do anything, his motives are ineffable and he can make it all any way he wants. What it *isn't* is 'scientific'. It is, therefore, a truism that it's unpopular amongst scientists.
There is no way they are able to monitor the mean temp, nor have a historical history of temp on Mars, it is a bunch of bull.  Mars is ot earth. MArs soes not have out atmosphere. Heat escaped more freely into space. Mars doesn't have the UV protection we have. Mars doesn't have trees that produce O2. There is now way you can even compare the two.
Okay pretty easy thing to know. When you burn something, like oil, you produce CO2. When CO2 is placed in large amounts in the atmosphere it heightens the temperature (proof in graph below). I'm all for walking and whatnot when you can, and against this addiction to oil. The gov't of denver shouldnt be doing it to the extent that they are now, but they have a good idea.  http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l263/Unriggable/deficit.gif
City governments have figured out that they have the magic wand of revenue.  There are people sitting in offices planning, 8 to 10 hours a day on how to get more of your money. They are very adept at their jobs.  Reminds me of Haliburton and Dick Cheney.
Reminds me of Haliburton and Dick Cheney. Reminds me of any of the 1% who sit around daily thinking up ways to screw the 99%.
jyoshu, I'd simply point out that scientists are in almost total agreement (you will always have a few fringys) that Global Warming is (1) occurring and (2) humans are a major contributing factor. Now we have the tools that we need to fix the problem.  Listed below is what Denver is doing according to the website jyoushu gave us: Making heavy users of electricity and natural gas pay more Charging residents who throw away a lot of trash  Setting energy-efficiency standards for new construction  Giving carpoolers and hybrids priority for parking   It sounds to me that they are saying "there is a serious problem and we need to change the way we act." It shows vision, it asks for sacrifice, and it both punishes abusers and rewards those who successfully change their behavior. These ideas are not only practical, but also easy to implement. From a "what can i do" perspective I like the idea. My family is currently preparing to purchase a hybrid car and looking into solar panels for our house. Not only are solar panels good for the environment, but they also save you a hell of a lot on energy! Again, you may see them as communist, but I instead see it as a good vision of a true American leader. Pull up the your sleeves and get to work! That's the American spirit.
jyoushu, no, i have to disagree with you. Most scientists fully agree that humans are a major contributing factor. I remember it being bounced in the news that the major scientific community (basically the ABA of scientists) released findings with strong language to the effect of both one and two. Now, i'll grant you they don't say they are 100% sure of it, but for scientists they use pretty strong language. You just have to understand where they are coming from.   Oh, and yes I understand that they are making it mandatory. I see global warming as a real threat. To counteract this threat we [society] must change some of our habits, and this is a good way to get habits to change. Unlike you, I have faith in the government, having been a public servant. You see, when people are acting in a negative manner, I believe that government is the way you get them to correct it, or at least one of many different available ways.
Actually, the DA's office I worked in had a murder trial going on. I watched national news several months ago and they claimed that up to a 20 bodies were found in the yard... I asked at our office and they were like ###? We have NO idea where they got that number. Our own investigators say it was more like 4-6.  In my experience the media often gets things in government wrong. I looked back at the report (as they did give a citation) and confirmed the information myself. As for government propaganda, you often find the ways to read between the lines and figure it out for yourself. You also learn to appreciate the other side because, most of the time, they have convictions that are just as honest and strong as yours... they just happen to be wrong ;). You disagree with them, you fight with them, sometimes you scream at them and they scream back, but at the end of the day, professionalism is able to shake hands, laugh it off, and say good job, let's get a beer. Cause at the end of the day, you still have to work with others.
They are in agreement on #1 yes, but on #2 they are not. There are a lot of scientists who aren't convinced of that and many of them have even said they feel the evidence says otherwise. One of the tactics those who push the global warming thing have used is to make the "total agreement" and "consensus" claims when in fact there in not complete consensus that humans are the main cause.   There have been two Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports this year. Their conclusions are:  "Warming of the climate system is unequivocal."  "Most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations."  http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM2feb07.pdf
thelmoose, thanks for finding the thing i was referencing earlier!
upon re-reviewing document I would direct your attention to page three, the charts show cyclical change, and then what has been happening recently seemingly far out of the cyclical norm.  Further supported by   The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650,000 years (180 to 300 ppm) as determined from ice cores. The annual carbon dioxide concentration growth-rate was larger during the last 10 years (1995 - 2005 average: 1.9 ppm per year), than it has been since the beginning of continuous direct atmospheric measurements (1960 - 2005 average: 1.4 ppm  per year)  The base line conclusion relevant here is:  The understanding of anthropogenic warming and cooling influences on climate has improved since the Third Assessment Report (TAR), leading to very high confidence(7) that the globally averaged net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming, with a radiative forcing of 1.6 [+0.6 to +2.4] W m-2.   Foot note seven says:    In this Summary for Policymakers the following levels of confidence have been used to express expert judgments on the correctness of the  underlying science: very high confidence at least a 9 out of 10 chance of being correct; high confidence about an 8 out of 10 chance of being  correct.   Further flushing out what my concerns are:    New data since the TAR now show that losses from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have very likely contributed to sea level rise over 1993 to 2003. Flow speed has increased for some Greenland and Antarctic outlet glaciers, which drain ice from the interior of the ice sheets. The corresponding increased ice sheet mass loss has often followed thinning, reduction or loss of ice shelves or loss of floating glacier tongues. Such dynamical ice loss is sufficient to explain most of the Antarctic net mass loss and approximately half of the Greenland net mass loss. The remainder of the ice loss from Greenland has occurred because losses due to melting have exceeded accumulation due to snowfall.   Global average sea level rose at an average rate of 1.8 [1.3 to 2.3] mm per year over 1961 to 2003. The rate was faster over 1993 to 2003, about 3.1 [2.4 to 3.8] mm per year. Whether the faster rate for 1993 to 2003 reflects decadal variability or an increase in the longer-term trend is unclear. There is high confidence that the rate of observed sea level rise increased from the 19th to the 20th century. The total 20th century rise is estimated to be 0.17 [0.12 to 0.22] m.   Finally page 9 lists dangers of global warming, and the lowest level it has for the option of "Likelihood of a human contribution to observed trend" is "More likely than not." That is, greater than 51%. The only reason that t is not higher is stated in footnote f, "Magnitude of anthropogenic contributions not assessed. Attribution for these phenomena based on expert judgment rather  than formal attribution studies." In other words, we have no formal proof yet, but our best guess of the experts based on preliminary data is...  conclusion I draw, humans are probably a cause, let us alleviate as much of the problem as we can!
There is definitely a controversy between whether or not Global Warming is happening or not. I know that where I live, the year-round temperature is actually getting colder! Anyway, even if Global Warming was a proven fact, nothing should change. We should still be trying to create as little pollution as possible, right? So, what does it matter?  Because global warming changes what we consider to be pollution. CO2 emissions are only really a pollutant because they contribute to climate change, because the levels for CO2 to be toxic to humans are order of magnitude higher than those presently in the atmosphere.
There is definitely a controversy between whether or not Global Warming is happening or not. I know that where I live, the year-round temperature is actually getting colder!  You live pretty far north yeah? Winters should go colder and summers hotter, that is what is happening and that is exactly what Global Warming predicts.   Anyway, even if Global Warming was a proven fact, nothing should change. We should still be trying to create as little pollution as possible, right? So, what does it matter?  Aside from coastal cities being flooded, the breadbasket of the US moving North, desertification of many places on the Equator, more complex problems over water (even water wars as predicted by some in the Pentagon), the end of skiing in many place, the list is pretty long.
There is definitely a controversy between whether or not Global Warming is happening or not.  There isn't. The controversy is over whether it's man-made or not.
There isn't. The controversy is over whether it's man-made or not.  And if we can actually doing anything about it. From what I hear on the fringes, the debate should not be about how to change or stop it, but how to change to deal with it and what we should expect as society adapts to a change in climate.
And if we can actually doing anything about it.Plant lots and lots of trees.emoticon_xgood
The earth is coming out of a third or fourth ICE AGE. It will get warmer for another few thousand years, then it will ice over again. There is nothing we can do about it. We are not contributing enough to the warming that we could reverse it if we stopped doing whatever it is that we do to contribute.  Al Gore is a shyster riding on the fears of dupes who think mankind controls the earth.  Any evidence to support this or is it just a neat excuse not to take any action?
Any evidence to support this or is it just a neat excuse not to take any action?  Probably neat excuse. Do you expect jim to back that claim up? emoticon_xgood Don't hold your breath.
The earth is coming out of a third or fourth ICE AGE. It will get warmer for another few thousand years, then it will ice over again.  Sure it will, according to one theory out of 500 that doesn't have evidence...  There is nothing we can do about it. We are not contributing enough to the warming that we could reverse it if we stopped doing whatever it is that we do to contribute.  Could you care to explain why the biggest jumps in temperature correspond to the Industrial Revolution? Why it is that for millions of years that the temperature doesn't fluctuate significently but the years we start adding huge amounts of emissions into the air the temperatures start to change?   Al Gore is a shyster riding on the fears of dupes who think mankind controls the earth.  So we don't? I thought we had the capacity to destroy it. That seems within the range of control eh?
Al wants you to think all we have to do is stop emitting CO2. He wants you to fear something that he knows how to fix...so you'll give him prizes for being a genius and solving the problem.  Gore can shove it. What he says doesn't matter. You're trying to fallaciously cast everyone who accepts global warming as a Gore supporter. There's far more then just CO2 as what is probably causing Global Warming, but to believe that nothing is happening is just stupid and to believe that throwing billions of tons of emissions into the atmosphere isn't going to do anything is just asinine.  Tell me, what has caused the global warming on Mars?...Jupiter? I understand the temperatures there have been rising more in the past few years than before. Think it could be resulting from their industrial age?  Do you always use fallacious arguments? Mars hasn't seen a spike like we have. Trying to argue that all warming is the same is dishonest.  Check the stats on his personal home. Check the emissions rating of his antique private jet. He claims to be doing his part by leading a carbon neutral life...which means he merely paid for permission to continue polluting the earth with his inefficient means of private transportation and his energy sucking home.  How does this prove he is wrong? Being a hypocrite does not make your arguments on things wrong. Someone is wrong for independent reasons, such as data is false, or they are just outright lying and you can prove it. If I say that murder is wrong and I kill someone, does that make murder right because I'm a hypocrite? No. Stop being dishonest and you are using the fallacy of changing the subject. Just because Gore is a hypocrite doesn't make his argument false.  I see you as always fail to actually provide a respectable source.  I see you outright refuse to address my points. As always.
I wonder if you even bothered to read your own links.  HEARTLAND INSTITUTE doesn't suggest that global warming isn't happening, only that solar radiation is partially at fault. Your assertion that it isn't happening is contradicted by your own source. The first doesn't allow access.  The second one (and third) is trying as you are, to cast all warming as the same. Tell me how that is a reasonable argument.   "These parallel global warmings -- observed simultaneously on Mars and on Earth -- can only be a straightline consequence of the effect of the one same factor: a long-time change in solar irradiance."  What? HOW? So pumping billions of tons every year of materials we know that trap heat won't raise temperature? Are you serious? Are you even going to bother to provide some evidence that suggest that the spike and rapid rises in temperature after the industrial revolution aren't true or just pretend that it didn't happen?  I noticed you didn't bother to check the links in your links.   From the last one: it link on pluto, the ACTUAL link says this : Jay Pasachoff, an astronomy professor at Williams College, said that Pluto's global warming was "likely not connected with that of the Earth.  The jupiter one puts this, which your site omitted: Little is known about how storms form on the giant planet.  And it puts all of the temperature change on the storm. How again does this help you?   The triton case: Elliot and his colleagues believe that Triton's temperature has increased because of indications that the pressure of the atmosphere has increased. Because of the unusually strong correlation between Triton's surface ice temperature and its atmospheric pressure, Elliot said scientists can infer a temperature increase of 3 degrees Fahrenheit over nine years based on its recent increase in surface vapor pressure.  Again, not helping you and in fact proving that warming can happen for a variety of reasons.   And the National Geographic is based off one ONE man who did not cite any evidence.   You fail. Hard.  Why are you constantly insisting that I do not address your points?  Because you don't. And people do believe it. Whether they believe you is something entirely different.  None of your links disprove Gore. Even if Gore is a hypocrite it doesn't make his argument wrong. You constantly fail to understand this even when I gave you a example that shows your logic makes the action correct if someone says it is wrong and then does it, particularly if you don't like that person.   If Gore did not exist it would not make global warming false.  Read your links carefully next time.
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071023/ap_on_sc/vanishing_glaciers  Explain that away.  Furthermore, carbon trading is similar to sulfur and other emissions trading.   Those obviously work. Why is carbon trading a sham and the multibillion dollar sulfur credit market not?   Or are you going to run away from that just as Archangel did?
You don't read too well yourself. I have not claimed that global warming is not happening.  You 'merely' implied it wasn't carbon based and provided links asserting that our warming was the same as theirs. Too bad you didn't read the links showing a variety of reasons for warming.   I never thought the links were claiming global warming is not happening. What I and the the links are saying is that Al Gore is full of it regarding how much we contribute to it. His movie is full of lies and he is hypocritical in asking us to conserve while he simply buys carbon credits so he can continue to pollute.  Obviously you didn't read your own links. Your links just show that warming happens for a variety of reasons, and that their warming isn't related to ours. In fact that actually hurts your argument as they show warming isn't uniform.
Is someone seriously you suggesting you can determine a trend with two data points? emoticon_xdonno
Around the world, thousands of scientists have devoted their professional lives to studying the climate. Not centrally organised, they sometimes build temporary affiliations but they remain scientists throughout &#8211; that is, they are independent, constantly challenge each other and are committed to searching for truth through objective, independently verifiable evidence.  Overwhelmingly, this evidence has led to four conclusions. The first is that the world is warming. The global average temperature has increased by about 0.8 degrees since 1850, with most of the increase occurring since 1950. The warming varies among decades because of natural fluctuations but the overall trend has been inexorably upward.  Warming is evident in other indicators, such as rising sea levels and reduced sea-ice and snow cover. Of these, the most important measure is the extra heat in the oceans, which is steadily rising. Claims that climate change has reversed since 1998 are misrepresentations of the full data.  The second conclusion is that the dominant cause of the warming since about 1950 is the increase in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases released by human activities, of which carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important.  This critical conclusion is based on several independent lines of evidence, including basic physics, studies of climate changes in both in the geological past and in the industrial era, and finally &#8211; but far from solely &#8211; from the predictions of climate models. Together, these provide an overwhelming case that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations cause warming, and that CO2 is the largest contributor to the current warming trend.  Other contributors include changes in the sun&#8217;s output associated with sunspots and solar flares, and volcanic dust. However, if these were solely responsible for temperature changes since 1850, the world should have cooled over the past half-century rather than warming at an increasing rate.  The third conclusion is that warming will increase in future, if emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases maintain their present paths. "Business as usual" scenarios for future emissions lead to likely global temperature increases of up to six degrees above present temperatures by 2100.  These are dramatic temperature increases, which would be accompanied by major disruptions to food supplies, river flows and water availability, significant and ongoing rises in sea level (of up to about a metre by 2100 and potentially metres over longer times), disease threats, disruptions to ecosystems including the extinction of many species, and social and geopolitical destabilisation.  The fourth conclusion is that climate change cannot be reversed for many centuries, because of the massive heat stores in the world&#8217;s oceans. Even if CO2 and other greenhouse gas concentrations were stabilised today at their present levels, a further warming of at least 0.6 degrees would inevitably follow (on top of the 0.8 degrees observed since 1850) and sea-level rise would continue for centuries to millenniums.  These four conclusions have been known and agreed among thousands of independent climate scientists for more than a decade. However, new findings suggest that the situation is, if anything, more serious than the assessment of just a few years ago.  The heightened concern among climate scientists arises from a growing realisation that climate change can be accelerated beyond current predictions by reinforcing "climate feedbacks", which contribute to climate change and are accelerated as it occurs, thus causing climate change to feed on itself. When these feedbacks are sufficiently strong they become "climate tipping points" which can flip the climate into a new state with essentially no way to recover.  Several feedbacks are of immediate concern. Interactions between climate and the earth&#8217;s carbon cycle (the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere, the land and the oceans) will act to accelerate climate change if sinks do not keep pace with emissions (as is already happening) and/or if previously stable carbon stores are released to the atmosphere under climate change, for example by the thawing of carbon-rich frozen soils.  Accelerated polar warming will cause loss of ice and a consequent darkening of the surface, leading to more heat absorption and faster warming. Atmospheric concentrations of aerosols (tiny particulates) are likely to decrease in future as nations improve air quality, leading to accelerated warming as the cooling effect of aerosols is reduced.  Oceans are becoming more acidic as a consequence of increased CO2 in the atmosphere. When CO2 concentrations exceed levels to be reached by 2035 under business-as-usual emissions scenarios, there will be severe disruptions to marine ecosystems (including the Great Barrier Reef and ocean food chains), which will endanger fisheries and weaken the uptake of CO2 by oceans.  Temperature rises of two to three degrees (or higher) carry a high risk of irreversible decay of the Greenland ice sheet from surface warming alone, leading to a sea level rise of up to about seven metres. Destabilisation of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would cause a further few metres of sea-level rise.  A climate conference in Copenhagen in March concluded that societies were highly vulnerable to even modest levels of climate change, with poor nations and communities particularly at risk. Temperature rises above two degrees will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with and will increase the level of climate disruption through the rest of the century.  All of these concerns are firmly grounded in science. They have led the great majority of climate scientists to conclude (paraphrasing the summary of the Copenhagen conference) that rapid, sustained and effective emissions reductions are required to avoid &#8216;&#8216;dangerous climate change&#8217;&#8217;, regardless of how it is defined.  Higher future emissions increase the risk of crossing climate tipping points and they increase the likelihood that the long-term social and economic costs of both adaptation and mitigation will be higher.

Well, I am in good company. :)  See you in hell then before it freezes over.  Gee! the power of the documentary, it caused global cooling. so the pen is mightier than CO2
Yes, Archie  Overwhelmingly, this evidence has led to four conclusions. The first is that the world is warming. The global average temperature has increased by about 0.8 degrees since 1850, with most of the increase occurring since 1950. The warming varies among decades because of natural fluctuations but the overall trend has been inexorably upward.  Warming is evident in other indicators, such as rising sea levels and reduced sea-ice and snow cover. Of these, the most important measure is the extra heat in the oceans, which is steadily rising. Claims that climate change has reversed since 1998 are misrepresentations of the full data.
Baloney! There has been major melting of ice at both the North and South Poles, meaning that far more of the sun's energy heat and energy will remain trapped in the Earth's atmosphere rather than being bounced off into outer space.  Further, enormously unseasonably warm weather recently experienced in the Pacific Northwest broke all sorts of historic records.  Temperatures of 104 degrees Farenheit in a region which very rarely registers three-digit temps.  In fact, the weather templates of the local TV stations were unable to easily record the record temperatures.  Also, the nightly temperatures also reached record highs never before recorded historically.  So.... where the devil is this global cooling that a single battalion of fools thinks is in existence?
What report?  the 29 year warming trend stands at 1.5 degree cent per century.  the trend is that the earth is warming. Of course is not a steady straight line as you well know. The surface temp on land and sea is rising. This is the scientific consensus.  by the way, if I remember correctly until recently you didn't care about 'scientific consensus' that you now invoke but you can not prove that is in your side.
Three glaciers in different climate zones of the U.S. Northwest have shrunk rapidly since 1989, confirming the impact of global warming on their decline, the government said in a report.   The glaciers in Alaska and the state of Washington have shown a &#8220;rapid and sustained&#8221; loss of mass over the two decades, according to today&#8217;s report from the U.S. Geological Survey. The South Cascade glacier in Washington is shrinking at a rate that may see it disappear in 50 years, said Edward Josberger, the report&#8217;s lead author.   Glaciers in the Northwest have gained or lost mass from year to year since the agency began collecting data in 1957, because of changes in winter storm patterns tied to shifts in Pacific Ocean currents, Josberger said. The cumulative decline since 1989 suggests that global warming has overcome those seasonal variations.  &#8220;That&#8217;s telling us something on a larger scale is happening,&#8221; Josberger, a senior scientist at the geological survey stationed in Tacoma, Washington, said in an interview.   Melting glaciers add to the rise of sea level, threatening low-lying and coastal communities. The loss of glaciers in the Northwest also affects rivers and streams where species such as bull trout and salmon live, Josberger said. Those fish prefer the colder, highly oxygenated water that runs off the glaciers in the spring and summer.   Maritime, Interior Glaciers   Two of the glaciers, Wolverine on Alaska&#8217;s coast and South Cascade, are in maritime climates that are strongly influenced by Pacific Ocean currents and winter storms. The third, Gulkana, is in the interior of Alaska where there is less annual snowfall and the temperatures are colder and drier.   Scientists track the growth and decline of glaciers by taking snow core samples and measuring the height of the annual snowfall. The data are used to estimate the net balance of a glacier, its average mass over a year.   &#8220;More than 99 percent of America&#8217;s thousands of large glaciers have long-documented records of an overall shrinkage as climate warms,&#8221; agency scientist Bruce Molnia said in a statement.   Global warming is shrinking glaciers in the Himalayan mountains, threatening water supplies in China and India, and increasing the likelihood of regional disputes, according to a report earlier this year from the Asia Society, a New York-based nonprofit group that promotes Asian-U.S. relations. Asia, with half the world&#8217;s population, has less fresh water than any continent except Antarctica.

The Astronomical Society of Australia have just released a report confirming we have embarked on a ~25 year global cooling trend, the scientific consensus is in and there is only a holdout amongst head in the sand denialists.  btw even if you don't believe in global cooling (which no sane or honest person would deny - do you work for a carbon capture corporation by any chance, hmmm!?), surely you agree that we have to do something now to prevent even the possibility of it!  do you by any chance work for the coal mining industry ?
ACT! emoticon_rolleyes
we will just pass a law preventing any of you global warming deniers from buying or using fnas or air conditioners in your cars, places of work or houses. but since the planet is cooling according to you ...   you live by the sword, you sweat by the sword
The Astronomical Society of Australia have just released a report confirming we have embarked on a ~25 year global cooling trend, the scientific consensus is in and there is only a holdout amongst head in the sand denialists.  btw even if you don't believe in global cooling (which no sane or honest person would deny - do you work for a carbon capture corporation by any chance, hmmm!?), surely you agree that we have to do something now to prevent even the possibility of it!  Interestingly, the Sun's solar cycle has been in the phase locked mode for the last 105 yr (1900-2005) and the indications are that it is about to suffer another phase catastrophe in the later part of cycle 24 (i.e. the solar cycle that will peak in ~2011-2012). If this is the case, then we should expect that in the two decades following the phase catastrophe, the world's mean temperature should be noticeably cooler i.e. the cooling should start in the late 2010s. This claim is based on the precedent that there were noticeable decreases in the world's mean temperature following the last two phase catastrophes. The cool period know as the Dalton Minimum (1800-1820) that followed the phase catastrophe in the early 1790s and a similar cool period called the Victorian Minimum (1880-1900) that followed the phase catastrophe in the late 1870s. http://www.publish.csiro.au/view/journals/dsp_journal_fulltext.cfm?nid=138&f=AS06018 The paper you reference (published in June '08) talks about cycles of solar activity. This paper in no way indicates that man made global warming is false. It suggests that solar activity occurs in cycles, and we may be coming to the end of a cycle of peak solar activity, after which the earth will cool a few degrees for a 20 year period. It is notable that if this does occur, it will be a temporary cooling. The overall temperature of the earth has increased dramatically over the past 200 years in spite of both the Dalton and Victorian minimums. So while this cooling could temporarily bring global temps down, they will return to pre-minimum levels, which will still be above average.   But then it should be noted that one of the authors of this paper recommended that we bulldoze snow to make it less reflective to counter the effects of global cooling. Genious. emoticon_rolleyes
people like you, specially you, ought to be taken to a sauna and let to steam at 100 degree C while waiting for the planet to cool. or better still be taken to a tropical island one of those sinking below sea level thanks to man induced global warming and buried to your neck on the beach waiting for the hight tide to come in or the sea level drop.
First of all snakespit, I had thought better of you than to schill for corporate interests, I guess I was wrong.  Secondly, we are past the point of debating the issue - it is too critical to the future of humanity to avoid global cooling to at this point have it in the hands of denialists and head-in-the-sanders. Either start shovelling coal or get out of the way, no more hand waving and do-nothing arguments designed to obfuscate the issue while you get rich exploiting the planet.  As the past illustrates, global cooling can easily run away, freezing much of the planet. If you have any sense at all you will agree we need to stop this from happening, regardless of how much you have invested in the carbon trading markets. The people warning about this are scientists, you are not qualified to disagree with them or question their logic.  If you want anyone to take you seriously you need to link peer reviewed papers from at least 10 qualified astronomers denying global cooling - I will then proceed to smear and defame them based on their age, race, gender, employer (past or present), education, papers published by them earlier in their careers, or tangential association with carbon trading corporations or government funded entities.  Either you are trolling, or completely impervious to logic and common sense. :)
 The total knowledge of all the people who believe in global warming on this forum is gleaned from newspapers and the internet. I dont believe anyone on here actually is involved in research.   That's actually a false dichotomy. I have studied related fields so I have some knowledge beyond the layman in the relevant areas of quantum physics, I'm by no means an expert in the field but to say all my knowledge comes from newspapers and the Internet is incorrect.  I have no doubt at all that there are solar radiation cycles that affect our climate. This has no bearing on the problems caused by CO2 emissions, the most it can do is provide a breathing space to get CO2 emissions under control. If temperatures are restrained slightly by a low point in natural cycles then it will give us time to get low carbon technology in place for when it reaches another peak - a peak in natural cycles plus the effect of CO2 emissions would be even worse.
Either you are trolling, or completely impervious to logic and common sense. :)   of course she is trolling, how many posting of hers you have to read to realize that?   she doesn't want to admit what she knows it's true so she is making fun of it.  making fun of it won't cool the Earth. :)  I suppose that had she been aboard the Titanic she would have denied it was sinking and kept on dancing until she was in the water.
if you knew anything about Greek mythology you ought to know that Cassandra was proven right  the difference between you and symbiote is that she knows that the earth is not cooling down, so she resorts to sarcasm trying to make fun of the scientific consensus that yes CO2 is warming up the planet. you instead think that really the earth is not warming up.  If you put a heater in a room and as the temperature is raising you turn on the air conditioner of course the room's temp will drop for as long as the aircond is on but it doesn't mean the heater is not introducing heat in the room. the earth's 'heater' is the CO2 we the human kind is pumping into the atmosphere.
I think Symbiote is making a valid point and not trolling at all! Anyone who doubts the certainty of global warming are called 'deniers' by the believers with the same venom that 'heretic' was used against others in the past . The total knowledge of all the people who believe in global warming on this forum is gleaned from newspapers and the internet. I dont believe anyone on here actually is involved in research.

Climate Skeptics Reveal 'Horror Stories' of Scientific Suppression (NYC Conference Report)  another article quoting scientists Jeepers creepers! FreeRepublic!  Like the bleeding Freepers have anything worthwhile to say.  Give me a break!
Same ol 'same ol' if it dont agree then it cant be right.  These are the views of people who have first hand information to research but do not agree with with the current religion! Simone cant even disagree with their views because she doesnt know anything about it so she says things like ptahemoticon_rolleyes  Thing is, when you quote those sort of sources, it's hard to respond to them without knowing how much of it theyve made up. We know, for example, that the 400 scientists claim is junk, the list containing a great many economists, others who agree with the science of global warming but think technology will get us out of the mess, and a great many who are no more scientists than I am (i.e. they have a degree in a science subject). Knowing that this list is complete hocum, what are we to make of the rest of the piece?
The problem with that argument is that for most of the 8 years of the Bush presidency, the US government was intent on trying to undermine climate change science, as were the major energy companies. Bush finally bowed to the overwhelming weight of the evidence and, yes, the consensus. There were plenty of people looking very hard to find alternative explanations for the evidence and the reality is that they failed totally. If a researcher, whether post-grad or post-doc or professor, finds compelling evidence that undermines the theories that underpin climate change they're going to be hailed as a genius, and if someone had already come up with this evidence then the denial industry would be proclaiming it from the rooftops, as they've already attempted to do with their myriad other attempts (sunspots et al). Finally if such evidence exist there ought to be some scientific papers outlining it. I've posted links in the past to an archive of the papers, dating back a century or more, that support climate change, where are the papers that undermine it?
if you don't know and you said that all information obtained in newspaper is false then why do you bother to provide it here ?  for someone who said that doesn't know it is clear from your postings that you had the strong opinion that the earth is not warming up. if you were consequent with your words you would not have an opinion either in favor or against global warming.  why do you think the glaciers are melting all over the world if the temp is not rising?   do you really think that basic science is wrong also and CO2 does not trap heat? This was proven in the XIXth century by the way.  so governments are listening to scientists who know nothing, such as the group of Australian scientists I quoted several times in this thread?  I suppose that if a loony tells you that the earth is flat that would be enough for you to believe it is so.  Have a look at any chart of temperature of the earth since the dawn of the industrial age and you will see an average steady rise. There are spikes up and down but the trend is definitely upwards.  If you want to sit and wait for the Titanic to sink be my guest, but the rest of us are pumping the water out and trying to plug the hole, if it is not too late already.  I know what people like you will say if nothing is done and the predictions come true:  "Well, it wasn't proven then, I had to see it with my own eyes to be convinced" and also of course "Why didn't the government do something, isn't that what the government is supposed to do?"  I suppose that the only way for you to be convinced that if you jump off a cliff you'll fall and kill yourself is to try it, right?  Well, most people have common sense and therefore listen to the consensus of the experts on the matter.
I think Symbiote is making a valid point and not trolling at all! Anyone who doubts the certainty of global warming are called 'deniers' by the believers with the same venom that 'heretic' was used against others in the past . I like the terms 'uneducated' and 'naive' better than 'denier'.   The total knowledge of all the people who believe in global warming on this forum is gleaned from newspapers and the internet. I dont believe anyone on here actually is involved in research. So my guess is as good as yours.  Spending time reading about any subject can be research. Just because someone is not a climatologist does not mean that they cannot educate themselves.
I dont know whether the earth is warming up or not and neither do you! I do.  So do these people.  As I stated China and India must be seen as a threat to mankind if they industrialise so why are we feeding the thing that will destroy us? Because many people don't believe it? Because some believe it but just don't care? Because people are greedy and more worried about making money? Should I continue?
Even if you 'know' the earth is warming up you and these people do not know if is man made...there is evidence but not proof There is no 'if' about it. The earth has been warming dramatically for the last 200 years. The temperature record does not lie.   So the question is this. If you are skeptical about man-made global warming...what is your alternative theory? Surely you have something.   You asked an intersting question a few posts back  Why arent we completely rethinkiing the way that we will live in the latter part of the 21st century so that we can reduce the amount of CO2 produced and cope with the effects of what we have already done?  Ask yourself that question. Many of us are already doing our part. Why aren't you?
If the earths temperature has been rising for the last 200 years then it probably isnt due to man then is it ?So turning your thermostat down will not make a lot of difference! Turning my thermostat down will not make a lot of difference, but if everyone turned their thermostat down...  And why would you say that man is probably not responsible? Ever heard of a little thing called the industrial revolution?   The answers are in my previous posts  You have repeated something similar to this over and over...  I have stressed time and time again that I get my source of information from the same place as you..the internet and newspapers and there are conflicting opinions from the internet and newspapers ! I did not say they were wrong or right. I said that none of us are climate scientists so we do not know OR my guess is as good as yours   Just because I am not a climatologist does not mean that I cannot educate myself and form an educated opinion. You seem to feel that only experts should be allowed to have a firm belief about global warming. I think you either lack basic reading comprehension and deductive reasoning skills, or you simply have not put time into learning about the subject.   The earth may or may not be warming up and if it is warming up it may or may not be due to increased CO2 in the atmosphere... While the involvment of CO2 is the most probable explanation by far, I could accept you saying that you do not believe that it is the cause of global warming. What I cannot accept is that you don't even seem willing to admit that the earth is warming up. That is a proven fact, yet you still seem unwilling to admit it. No wonder people like you are called 'deniers'.   I will ask again...  Do you have any alternative theory to explain why the earth has warmed dramatically?
We'll take that as a no, then. Contrarianism might seem fun, but it is intellectual bankruptcy.
Are you kidding me? You think that the Industrial revolution started the warming the Earth 200 years ago.And you say you have studied global warming? You obviously do not know anything about the Industrial revolution if you think the amount of energy gained fron coal was enough to start global warming from 200 years agoemoticon_xdonno It has nothing to do with "amount of energy gained"...whatever that means. It does however have to do with the release of greenhouse gases due to the mass burning of fossil fuels that began back in the mid to late 18th century (strangely enough, about the time of the beginning of the idustrial revolution). The first appreciable rises in global CO2 concentration appeared ~1840.   I have put forward my reasons for being sceptical about man made global warming. Where?  Do you not know what the word 'if' means I have not actually denied the earth is warming up. I dont know and nor do you. I also stressed that IF the Earth is warming up there still is the question of whether it is man made or not. Herein lies the problem. Until you can accept some basic facts, you are not worth debating. I already posted a link showing global temps, including the unprecedented increase since ~1950. There is no doubt that the global temp has risen, the only question is what has made it rise? If you are not ready to unequivocally accept the facts regarding the global temp increase, then you have no business in this debate.
As usual Penfold trolls without reading the postsemoticon_xclown  ..........While Gansao demonstrates the accuracy of Penfold's assessment.
 As I said on the last post I am quite willing to accept for the purpose of debate that the global temperature is rising. It may well be rising. Between 5000 and 3000BC average global temperatures were warmer than they are today and 1550 to 1850 AD there was a cooling period known as the little Ice age. So just as the earth warmed up ..it cooled later There was even serious talk of a forthcoming ice age predicted by scientists in the 1970s. What you and the other warmers seem to insist on is that the rise is a caused by human activity.  Thing is, we know that heightened CO2 levels cause warming, it's a matter of basic physics. We know that CO2 levels have increased massively in recent years, now around 35% above the long term average. We know that the increase is a result of human activity. The only topic for discussion is how much of an increase will be caused in the future.
Those liberal glaciers are only melting to make a political point!  " U.S. scientists monitoring shrinking glaciers in Washington and Alaska reported this week that a major meltdown is under way.  The Gulkana glacier in Alaska is one of three glaciers considered a benchmark by the U.S. Geological Survey.  A 50-year government study found that the world's glaciers are melting at a rapid and alarming rate. The ongoing study is the latest in a series of reports that found glaciers worldwide are melting faster than anyone had predicted they would just a few years ago.  It offers a clear indication of an accelerating climate change and warming earth, according to the authors. ...... "   Glaciers a canary in the coal mine of global warming - CNN.com
There is no overriding government interest in climate change that I can see. It would be an awful lot easier in both Britain and the US to rely on coal. Britain has coal for 300 years or more (and considerable marginal oil shales in places like North Somerset), I could see an argument for a tory government 20 years ago not wanting coal from a political point of view, but any government today would rather do without the headache of nimbyism over wind turbines and nuclear power. I don't see an interest for the government in higher energy prices either. Either politicians have genuine concerns about climate change, or they are responding to public concerns about climate change for electoral expediency.  I agree that the short term impact of energy saving measures will be cancelled out by growth in China and India, but in 10 years time we need to be able to go to India and China and say, "look, we know it wouldn't be fair to ask you to not develop in order to save the world from the mess we made, but we've cut our contribution as much as possible, here's the tech we've used now can you agree to use this in future and develop more sustainably?" There's already signs of this happening with India asking for development money for a massive photo-voltaic solar plant.  As for fusion, I don't know enough detail the make a judgement of my own, but I understand that cold fusion is impossible as far as our current knowledge of physics goes, and hot fusion will need to be on a massive scale to produce rather than consume energy, because containing plasma is hugely energy consuming.
Keep mining coal and pumping petroleum, the more the better for they are non-renewable resources and the sooner we run out of them, the sooner our civilization will collapse and that is good news for the planet and all other species except our own. Imagine a pristine planet, without the worst animal ever to walk on the face of the Earth, the most destructicve pest ever, gone for good or reduced to a few million instead of billions. No more mass slaughter of whales, fish, chicken, pigs, horses, cows etc. No more cruel raising of animals for the consumption of the human kind. No more 'experimentation' with defenseless animals either. No more destruction of wild life and their habitat, no more mass extinctions of species by the human kind. No more oil spills, no more toxic waste, no more radioactive waste. So I thank China, India, and the US of A for helping rid the planet of the human race. That is being greenies with a capital G.  By a big car, a humvee preferably, and fly around the world as often as you can. Have lots of fat kids. Have a great time at the airconditioned mall. Eat as much as you can. Consume as if there is no tomorrow. It is all for a good cause: to save our beautiful blue planet.  Enjoy! emoticon_xgood
Problem is that we're likely to cause a mass extinction event of the kind that has wiped out 95% of the species alive at the time. Plus human beings are like cockroaches, when pressed we'll live in almost any conditions.

Two scientists, Michael F. Wehner and David R. Easterling, show that such decade-long fluctuations are quite common in weather history. From day to day, season to season, and year to year, the weather shows great variability thanks to natural factors like capricious wind patterns and ocean currents. Changes in climate -- that is, changes in typical weather conditions over long periods of time -- are more difficult to assess. These short-term changes, say the scientists, must be differentiated from long-lasting, consequential trends in order to determine the role of human activities in shaping climate and to formulate industrial policy -- such as imposing a tax on carbon emissions. Wehner, who works at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., says that the long-term trend really is toward a warmer planet, but that a single year, 1998, has temporarily thrown off the overall upward march in temperature. In that year, an immense transfer of heat from the western to the eastern Pacific occurred: El Nino (Spanish for "Christ Child"), which often coincides with Christmas time. An El Nino event can have a major impact on rainfall patterns and temperatures over several continents. El Nino and other weather factors can cause a short reversal in the warming trend for a year. A 10-year reversal is less likely, but still possible. Just as in throwing a coin, seven heads in a row is unexpected, but it does happen now and then. In the journal Geophysical Review Letters, Wehner says that even a period of 20 years of modest cooling -- the equivalent of throwing 20 heads in a row -- would not reverse the scientific finding that long-term world temperature is trending upward; the trend is based on data now stretching back more than a century. Does this mean that after 10 years of relative cooling the next few years will be particularly warm in order to make up the cool years? No -- scientists can only say that the overall trend, over many years, is toward higher temperatures. No unusually warm day in January or unusually cool day in July can negate the overall trend. Neither can a cooling decade negate a century-long warming trend. In making policy decisions, argues Wehner and Easterling, don't let today's weather or even this year's weather influence your judgment. Concentrate on the long-term trend. This story was reported by Inside Science News Service.
That's because they have no substantial evidence to support their faith in man made global warming. Here are numerous short yet informative videos which make some very interesting points.  YouTube - Another scientist comes out against global warming  is the Bible in youtube?  what about another scientist comes out in favor of the flat earth ?
I see only bluster and diversion from global cooling denialists. Not one has been able to come up with a list of ASTRONOMERS (scientists, rather than crackpots) who oppose global cooling hysteria, which really says it all.  Thing is, we know that heightened CO2 levels cause warming, it's a matter of basic physics. We know that CO2 levels have increased massively in recent years, now around 35% above the long term average. We know that the increase is a result of human activity. We know that the Earth is cooling. We know that when the Earth cools, much of life will be wiped out. The only topic for discussion is how much of an increase in CO2 outpot will be needed in the future to save the world from catastrophic cooling.  we know you are a troll.
I can't understand why a scientific issue such as global warming end up being treated as a religious issue. Of course religious fundamentalists such as archie deny it is happening because they think only God can change the climate. I suppose the rest just find it an uncomfortable truth and think that denying it, will make it go away.  The Guardian had an interesting piece about it today:  Climate change deniers claim they're censored. What hypocrites. Anthony Watts, sceptic and scourge of climate change science, has used copyright laws to censor an opponent  One of the allegations made repeatedly by climate change deniers is that they are being censored. There's just one problem with this claim: they have yet to produce a single valid example. On the other hand, there are hundreds of examples of direct attempts to censor climate scientists.  Most were the work of the Bush administration. In 2007 the Union of Concerned Scientists collated 435 instances of political interference in the work of climate researchers in the US.  Scientists working for the government were pressured by officials to remove the words "climate change" and "global warming" from their publications; their reports were edited to change the meaning of their findings, others never saw the light of day. Scientists at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the US Fish and Wildlife Service were forbidden to speak to the media; James Hansen at Nasa was told by public relations officials that there would be "dire consequences" if he continued to call for big cuts in greenhouse gases.  Philip Cooney, a senior White House aide who previously worked at the American Petroleum Institute, admitted to Congress that he had made hundreds of changes to government reports about climate change on behalf of the Bush government.  Among other changes, he had struck out evidence that glaciers were retreating and inserted phrases suggesting that there was serious scientific doubt about global warming. In the UK, both Viscount Monckton and Martin Durkin, the director of Channel 4's The Great Global Warming Swindle, have threatened to sue people who have criticised the claims they've made about the science.  Where, on the other hand, is a single verifiable instance of a climate denier being silenced by the authorities? They have yet to produce one. But it suits them to cry wolf. They love to imagine that they are important enough to censor. The claim chimes with their paranoid invocation of a great conspiracy - involving most of the world's scientists, most of the world's governments, most of the world's media and a few hundred million others - to suppress the truth about global warming.  Now we have another marvellous instance of this hypocrisy. Anthony Watts spends much of his time maligning climate scientists and environmentalists on his blog Wattsupwiththat. But while he can dole it out, he can't take it. As Kevin Grandia of desmogblog shows, Watts has just used US copyright laws to take down a YouTube video which exposes his claims. Grandia has since reposted the video (see above) so you can see for yourself what all the fuss is about.  It is not clear how his copyright was infringed by the video, but the US laws have been widely used by other people to block material that they don't like. Websites are obliged to remove any video which is subject to a takedown request, and they can put it back up only if they win an appeal. I charge Watts with the accusation he unjustly levels at other people: this looks to me like an attempt to silence his critics.  Climate change deniers claim they're censored.

You have taken a side. Your side is that nothing will convince you that global warming is hapenning. Your excuse is that you are not a scientist, therefore you can't decide, that is your way out.  So if a doctor tells you, you are sick, you don't believe it. No, you have to become a doctor yourself to decide for yourself if you are sick or not.  If a mechanic tells you your car needs a spare part, you also don't believe him, you have to become a mechanic yourself and you decide if he is right or not.  Funny way to live.  Is this the way an educated person functions?  Why do you think governments have scientific advisors?   Yes, you are right Obama must go back to Uni get a degree in environmental sciences, specifically in climate, do all the tests himself and then decide. But if he after doing all of the above decides that yes the climate is changing due to human intervention that would not be enough for you, because Obama probably has a hidden agenda, he is a Nazi or a Socialist blah blah  I think nothing will convince you because you are too scared to face the truth. You can't face the truth. Period
I disagree. There is a huge windfall to be gained by our government (US) in the form of Cap and Trade. Selling CO2 credits is like selling the "ether" that fills the universe. It is a license to print money and our liberal government sees that with crystal clarity.   The government already has a licence to print money, it doesn't need another one. Besides, if the government raises revenue from CO2 credits instead of other taxation, all it does it alter the tax base. If the government needs more revenue then it's not a bad way of getting it. Governments don't raise taxes to spend on swimming pools and hookers (actually may be they do in the US, the way bills get through congress I wouldn't be surprised to find a "Company for lonely Congressmen" rider attached to the climate change bill) they spend it on infrastructure and helping people (and blowing things up of course).    Additionally, pumping 10's of billion of taxpayer dollars into renewable energy projects creates jobs and keeps politicians in office.  So, it is imperative that Obama and crew sell the idea of AGW to the gullable public in order for him to finance his liberal programs.   Sorry, renewable energy is going to create jobs and so you think this is a bad thing?!   Are you serious? You expect China to curtail its growth in order to "save the world"? That's a lot to ask of a country that has almost zero regard for the environment now.    That's not what I said, I said we can't expect carbon cuts from China until we can offer them the technology to continue to grow and cut carbon at the same time. It's outrageous for us to expect them to keep their people in poverty before we put a brake on our wasteful lifestyles.
You're vastly exaggerating the space required for solar. Wind is part of the solution, but so are wave, tidal, biomass and others. Solar hot water heating is very efficient and cost effective, for example, and would drastically cut gas and electricity use. Using reflectors to focus sunlight onto water to drive turbines and generate electricity also has a lot of promise. The other key thing is that energy consumption needs to be cut, insulation, heat exchange systems, better build quality will all make a big dent in energy consumption, before we get on to actual lifestyle changes, like fuel efficient vehicles and public transport.
Clean coal fired power stations don't even exist.
Cleaner yes, clean no. There is no such thing as a clean coal fired power station.
Solar heating of water is already in widespread use in those areas that actually get regular sunlight. I saw many examples of it while in Hawaii, for example. For the rest of us though, especially those of you in foggy England, solar isn't a viable answer.  Additionally, there needs to be a back-up system for when the sun isn't shining...like at night, which occurs on a regular basis. ;)  And as for the land requirements needed for solar farms, I'll dig up the number of thousands of square miles needed based on a study that I read when I get a chance to.  On edit:  The largest solar farm will be 80MW peak and occupy 640 acres - 1 square mile. The US electricity consumption for 2005 was 3,816,000,000 MWh. Assuming 365 days of sunlight at peak output for 12 hours/day, you'd still need 11890 square miles of solar panels to meet US' 2005 demand. Now, if we convert to electic automobiles, we'll need to start building our houses on pontoons in the ocean because there won't be enough land left for houses. ;)  Check my math though, I'm doing this while working.  Assuming you're right, that's an area around 110 miles by 110 miles, to put that in perspective, the total area of the US is around 3.8 million square miles, so you'd have to cover maybe, being generous and say we need 3 times as much area for access roads, power lines, electric cars etc, 1% of the total land mass of the US. And that assumes you want to get all power from solar, which is by no means sensible.  As for solar only being effective in hotter climbs, I've just come back from holiday in Orkney, staying in a cottage where the main water heating was by solar energy, and perfectly adequate (ok it's summer but still, the wind gets up quite a lot in winter so it balances out).
You're absolutely right regarding the land these technologies require in order to become feasible. And the loss of that land for farming, wildlife habitats and development will cost society more than the energy created by the technology.  Wrong.  Solar thermal power plants use less land than hydroelectric dams or coal plants for a similar output. While all power plants require land and have an environmental impact, the best locations for solar power plants are deserts.
No, he really isn't. Solar and wind require monstrous amounts of land to be feasible.  A 1,000 megawatt facility would require over enormous amounts of land for solar, and even greater for wind.  The NERC is projecting that by 2017, energy consumption in merely the US will be 925GW for summer and 756 GW for winter.  That's "G" as in GIGA.  10,000 acres? In a desert? No biggie.  AV Solar Ranch One is a proposed 230 MW power station owned by NextLight Renewable Power. The photovoltaic array will occupy about 2,100 acres (850 ha) in the Antelope Valley. They will sell the electricity for 13c per Kwh. (Photovoltaic arrays are not the most efficient converters of energy available.)
I would like some evidence these technologies have actually been installed anywhere on earth yet in a sand dune type DESERT. I would be very concerned about the damage sandstorms could and would do to the mechanisms and moving parts in both solar screens which turn to angle toward the sun and wind turbines which are finely balanced blades. I can envision the havoc caused by the fine sand from every sand storm which came by. The maintenance in such an environment would be cost prohibitive. Antelope Valley is not such a desert atmosphere and could be utilized for farming as the poppy fields show. California State Parks  And you are dead wrong in saying that Coal fired plants use more land than wind or solar farms. You are off by a factor of around 10,000%.  Note PROPOSED solar farm it will be built next year. There are several already functioning in a little place called the MOJAVE desert. Nellis AFB has one. Where does the coal for a coal fired plant come from? Vast opencast mines. DOH!
Everyone knows that the ice sheet on Greenland is melting. But new research shows it is disappearing much faster than previously thought. The findings could mean that ocean levels are also rising more quickly. The dimensions of this frosty giant go way beyond human imagination. With a surface area spanning some 1.7 million square kilometers (656,000 square miles), a view of Greenland's ice above the Sermeq-Kujalleq glacier near Ilulisat makes it seem endless. The idea that this sheet of ice, which is up to three kilometers thick in parts, is melting seems absurd in the extreme. Were Greenland to lose all of its ice, sea levels would rise some seven meters higher than today's levels. Such a scenario will not become reality overnight -- indeed the process could last hundreds of years. But new results from a team of Dutch researchers suggest that conservative estimates as to the speed with which the ice is melting should be shelved. According to the study, the rate at which Greenland's ice is melting has accelerated substantially in recent years. There are, strictly speaking, two parallel processes responsible for the ice's retreat. On the one hand, rising temperatures melt the ice on land while warmer ocean currents eat away at the glaciers that jut out into the ocean. A research team led by Michiel van den Broeke from the University of Utrecht reported in the most recent edition of the journal Science that the two processes are contributing equally to the disappearance of the ice sheet. Losing Weight  According to the new report, Greenland lost an estimated 1,500 gigatons (one gigaton is equal to 1 billion tons) of ice from the year 2000 to 2008. "That is at the upper end of recent estimates of Greenland mass loss using various other methods," van den Broeke told SPIEGEL ONLINE. Between 2006 and 2008, the loss in weight totaled 273 gigatons per year, he said.  The scientists are convinced their results are accurate because they arrived at their numbers using two fundamentally different methods -- both of which returned the same conclusion. On the one hand, they monitored the movement of the ice which they fed into a regional computer model. For a second data source, they used the Grace observation satellites, which measure the Earth's gravitational field.  In the period between 2000 and 2008, the dwindling glaciers have been responsible for the sea level rising by an average of about half a millimeter per year. However, during the last three years of observation, the value rose to 0.75 millimeters per year. According to the researchers, these results could indicate that the sheet of ice is melting at an accelerated rate.
