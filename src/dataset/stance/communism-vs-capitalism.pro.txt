Capitalism is the only system that works with our natural existence. No one ever sacrifices themselfs for anything inwhich they do not have a stake in short or long term. It is a deinal of self perservation to be alutistic. Why should socity domand anything from me inwhich I do not constent to? Is that not salvery? the only thing we can ask for is that we ensalvery ourselves and not others, becuase the only person that can force you to a full life of work is yourself. Work for yourself to do what you like and not what others like, and in capitalism, you get to reep the rewards of both Mazslos highest fulliment of happiness (reaching a higher goal) and weath. Seeking weath for weath's sake is wrong, becuase the only way one can do that is by forcing others into things that contradicts with their own ego and goals. I should be expected to do what I am best at, and persue that with vigor. Anything else is without constent is salvery, and I have no one to blame but myself for the lack of insite on my ownself to see the flaw of expecting others to take care of ourself and creating a system that promotes some form of moral salvery.  And if one person creates something that was becuase of their self salvery to acheave a life goal, how does that negitively affect others? It doesnt, infact, those people who couldnt create it, now have it to their benifit. But the great irony about such people that have be sure of their ego are the to contrubted to our lifes and become the target of masses for distruction for nonlogical reason, like Socreties. its this people that would be oppressed in other systems, and becuase of that, we all loose.
There is a flaw with the question itself. Capitalism is not a form of government. However, the government can impose it. The only time that this has ever been the case remains in places like the Soviet Union, which Tito dubbed as state capitalism. China has been able to avert the kind of destruction seen by the former Soviet Union by allowing more free-market elements within their economic system.   That is the fundamental difference of the system that Fllingupwards proposes, and free-market economies. The point of the free-market is to key the two entities separate. Here government slightly regulates the market system. In socialism, government takes control of many or all means of production. Clearly, it is easy to see how socialism is both a political and economic system. Where as, this remains untrue for a democratic government that adheres to free-market principles. The best system is obviously the free-enterprise system that has allowed the great technological advances that we have grown accustomed to.
I agree with broker, of coarse. I MYSELF have needed help and am grateful to have recieved it when I needed it. There are success stories. When someone abuses help, it should be taken away. Today..... thanks to people abusing it, there are single pregnant women (like you guys were saying) who bust there hump and work full time and pay there way in life on there own. When they go to apply for AID, they get tossed around in the system, and never recieve medical assistance. That's because there is a women out there who sits at home all day with her baby, and lives with a boyfriend, and has it real easy. Robinhood, I mean, Falling, I have been poor. I dropped out of school, Today I (at 20) have my own apartment, and worked my butt off to be able to live in comfort for well over a year. There was a time I hated Capitalism, because conservatives weren't as naive as the bleeding heart liberals, who enabling me to as broker said (i think) be lazy! I dont want the little bit of money I have to work with being taken away from me to enable someone else. To help em' out sure but, 85% is a freakin' joke!!!!!
Whole nother debate, but the rich earned it too. Robinhood was a good guy, but the people he was stealing from to give to the poor were mean bad guys, not every rich person is like that. That's what makes our country so great! Your opportunities are up to you. Just because someone earned a better living doesn't mean that they should get hit harder.
In the end it's all a way to control us, and blind us to the fact that our freedom is being taken away!
Depends on where our money goes, and I am not brainwashed.:p
unemployment did not decrease during reagans administration, it increased. and the deficit remained extremely high until clinton's administration.  can you please respond to FDR and his New Deal that saved the country?  FDR saved this country? If I recall, it was in 1933 that, because of a combination of weakened capital situations from Reconstruction Finance Corporation loans which published lists of the loan takers, and a nation-wide banking holiday, banks around the country went through a new wave of demise, dropping the D/C and D/R ratios so sharply that, in one month alone, the money stock (M2) fell a whopping 4 1/2%.  Wasnt it under FDR that the NIRA codes, and, after 1935, the NLRA, enacted minimum wages, driving up nominal wages and thus unemployment?  Wasnt it during FDR administration that the reserve ratio was *doubled*, sending us back into another recession starting 1937?  The only thing FDR "saved" was the depression for a couple more years.  -GFA
i thought that this would be a good thread to distinguish between socialism and communism. i think most people do not really understand the differences between the two.
They are supposed to be different but they are not. In the end they both do the same thing: take money away from the rich and give it to the poor, and make us all like robots. (Same income, same house, same car, same job, etc.)
can i get a response by someone who really knows something about this topic (not someone who has been brainwashed into thinking capitalism is God)
i have been confused about the differences between the two. i have heard that communism gives money to the government and socialism gives money to the people. if this is the case, then i definitly favor socialism. i've also heard that communism favors in exact equality in the wealth of every citizen, while socialism works for a more equal distribution of wealth but not exactly equal. i do know that socialist countries have free health care and a lot of cool government programs. i also know that communist countries suppress many freedoms such as speech.  socialism to me seems to be halfway between capitalism and communism. it takes the best of both worlds. it takes the idea of equal wealth from communism and the idea of freedoms such as speech from capitalism. but the main reason why i started this thread was to clear up my misunderstanding about the differences between the two.  american, based on ur previous posts, i know that you probably despise socialism and love capitalism. so when you respond and tell me the differences between socialism and communism, just give me the facts not your personal opinion. i am not interested in a debate between capitalism and socialism, i am interested in a debate between socialism and communism. thank you.
fallingupwards: I have not been "brainwashed" as you say. Okay, if you want to debate with facts then here they are:  Socialism: 1 : any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods 2 a : a system of society or group living in which there is no private property b : a system or condition of society in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the state  3 : a stage of society in Marxist theory transitional between capitalism and communism and distinguished by unequal distribution of goods and pay according to work done.   Communism: 1 a : a theory advocating elimination of private property b : a system in which goods are owned in common and are available to all as needed 2 capitalized a : a doctrine based on revolutionary Marxian socialism and Marxism-Leninism that was the official ideology of the U.S.S.R. b : a totalitarian system of government in which a single authoritarian party controls state-owned means of production c : a final stage of society in Marxist theory in which the state has withered away and economic goods are distributed equitably d : communist systems collectively   Reference: www.m-w.com (mirriam webster dictionary)  As you can see, socialism and communism are very similar. Both systems require citizens to work in state owned production plants where the products are then given to the government for "equal distribution". Is that a good enough explanation for you?
calli, i know the dictionary definition of the two terms. i am merely trying to have a discussion of the differences between the two. the american people have been trained to think that anything other than capitalism is evil. you have obviously fallen victim to this. capitalism gives all the money to the very rich. did you know that one percent of the american population holds 80% of the wealth? that means that for every dollar, one percent gets 80% and the other 99% have to split the 20 cents. that doesnt sound very fair to me.  and dont give me that XXXX that those people earned it. are you trying to imply that only one percent of the united states works hard and the other 99% are lazy??
Guess who gives people jobs in the first place? Business owners! (a.k.a. "rich people") If they have more money, then they can hire more people. Less money for them means more layoffs for us. No I am not implying that the other 99% are lazy, I am implying that they can't get jobs unless the business owners (a.k.a. "rich people") have money to hire them in the first place!
excuse me for believing that business owners should not make billions and billions of dollars. excuse me for having compassion for the poor. excuse me for following Christ's example by believing the rich should share their wealth with the less fortunate. i apologize
You're excused. Just because Christ told the rich to share their money with the less fortunate doesn't mean that the government has the right to force them to. Why shouldn't business owners make billions and billions of dollars? They earned it! More jobs for us!
most rich people did not earn their billions of dollars. many of them inherit it. look at the Rockefellers for instance. they dont work hard. they got all their money passed down to them. look at George W. he's an idiot but he's rich because he inherited it from his father.  please please please. enough with the "they earned it" XXXX. i have used this example countless of times before. i'm going to be a teacher after college. i'm going to be poor the rest of my life. are you trying to say that i'm not working hard???? if you are, then you are a very very ignorant person (even though i think you already are). i'm going to work just as hard (or probably harder) than those billionares but i'm going to be poor.   in a socialist country, this would not be the case. we should tax the rich more and give their extra money to the WORKING class.  Jesus Christ clearly said in the bible that the rich MUST give to the poor in order to be accepted into the kingdom of heaven. the problem is, MOST rich people do not give money to the poor, relative to how much they make.
most rich people did not earn their billions of dollars. many of them inherit it. look at the Rockefellers for instance. they dont work hard. they got all their money passed down to them. look at George W. he's an idiot but he's rich because he inherited it from his father.  Yeah, they inherited it from their parents...who earned it.  please please please. enough with the "they earned it" XXXX. i have used this example countless of times before. i'm going to be a teacher after college. i'm going to be poor the rest of my life. are you trying to say that i'm not working hard???? if you are, then you are a very very ignorant person (even though i think you already are). i'm going to work just as hard (or probably harder) than those billionares but i'm going to be poor.  Why didn't they earn it? Just because you have made the decision to become a teacher doesn't mean that you don't have the opportunity to also become a billionare. You are deciding to become a teacher, which doesn't pay much. They just decided to invent new products and sell them which made them billions. Until you know what it is like to run a business, you can't make judgment calls by saying that you are going to work "just as hard" or "harder" than they do.
i'm going to be a teacher because i love history and thats what i want to do. so why should i be punished for it? why should i have to live in poverty for working just as hard as a billionare. i should be able to work hard at something and make a REAL contribution to society without being poor.   a person should not become a billionare based on what their parents did. are you in favor of our government offices being passed down in peoples families? for example, should every president be in the Bush family? after all, the first one did earn it.  you didnt answer my other comment. Jesus clearly stated that the rich will not enter the kingdom of heaven if they do not share their wealth with the poor. he said "it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven". most rich people do not share their wealth, and as a result there is a huge unequal distribution of wealth. it is the government's responsibility to look after the people. therefore, the government must help the poor.

Oh, so business owners don't make "real" contributions to society?  a person should not become a billionare based on what their parents did. are you in favor of our government offices being passed down in peoples families? for example, should every president be in the Bush family? after all, the first one did earn it.  Whoa boy, slow down there. I didn't say that government offices should be passed down. What are you going to do...make inheritence illegal?  you didnt answer my other comment.

You didn't read my answer obviously. Just because people have money doesn't mean they HAVE TO share it. The government doesn't have the right to take money away from the rich and give it to the poor. So what if rich people don't give money to the poor! It's THEIR CHOICE. God tells us to give money to the poor, but he also gave us a free will. It's not the governments responsibility to help the poor, it's the church's responsibility.
According to Marx socialism further perfects itself when it moves into communism. Free speech is opressed because someone will always want to change the system.   The only way socialist states support themselves is with very, very high taxes. The government takes enough from us already... that's why poverty rates are higher in many socialist countries...the goverment takes even more (Source: CIA Factbook, 2002).  I understand that a lot of people are poor, but sometimes its their own fault. It's not our job to bail them out because they made a huge mistake. A good example is getting pregnant. A lot of girls have to jump out of school and leave their previous lives. They made the mistake, the did the stupid thing. I don't want to pay for it.  Most rich people give a lot of their family fortunes away when they die. Bill Gates' will gives most of his money to charity, and he already has a $30 billion foundation. He leave enough for his children to live comfortable lives. I have no problem with that. He started the company, he bought most of the stock. The company didn't pay him billions, the stock soared. Good for him. He generated a lot of wealth and money that people and the government would not have.   Carnegie and Rockefeller did something similar. Carnegie wrote that "The man who dies rich dies disgraced." Both of them gave billions of dollars in today's money away.   Rich people can do what they want. They keep things moving. It's rich people who start most new companies... they have enough money to spare some.
Bill Gates actually makes around $250,000 a year... the same most of the other executives of Microsoft make.   I was looking into starting a business. I've planned for a long time and my projections tell me it would probably work. But the complicated tax code and high tax rates won't let that business off the ground...   If that business were to succeed, I'll give myself a nice salary. I started the business. If the employees aren't happy with what I pay them thats too bad. Executives work very, very hard. They have to often take personal responsibility for what their company does. They've usually been the ones who planned the business or who went to college for four years to get their degree to run that business. It sort of boils down to intelligence and how lazy a person is. I'm trying to get into the IB Program so that I stand a good chance of not having to pay so much for my post-secondary education. My parents can't really help me with it. But you want to take even more from them so everyone can have healthcare. That is insane. Don't punish people too much for being successful. I would not mind paying a high tax rate if I was rich, but I don't want you taking more than half of my money. I made that money, not you. And that money you were supposed to spend educating me? Yeah, never saw it. Didn't go to me or the people in the class who will grow up to make 60% of the change. Reorganize your priorities. You aren't going to help me so much, but if I become successful you'll want my money.   My science teacher had a gifted program when he was in 1st grade. Out of around 18 people, 11 went on to get doctorates. One is the chief Chinese translator for the UN. Now look at them! Look at what they did! But Uncle Sam didn't spend any more money on them...those other six may have gone on to be just as successful.
Bah, most of these debates are completely seperate from their titles. Just can't help myself.
i apologize american. i assumed that you would try to convert me to capitalism cuz your name is "american" and that was wrong of me. i'm sorry.  socialism is much better than communism because it allows us to keep our basic freedoms such as speech.  broker, i think you mentioned in a separate post that you are a christian. yet whenever you make posts, you certainly dont talk like one. christians are supposed to have compassion for the needy and be merciful. just because a teenager makes one single mistake by getting pregnant does not mean that she should have to pay for that mistake the rest of her life. you dont want to help those people? that is borderlining on greed, my friend. Christ taught us to show mercy on those who have sinned (actually we all have sinned). try to be more like Christ, and you will find yourself to be a much more friendly, compassionate, and loving person. :)
i would sure as hell hate to pay for someone elses screw ups, like some teenagers baby that she had, its her damn problem  so because a bunch of business men make alot of money, they should give it to a bunch of bums and failures  now im sure there are people out there that have had no choice but to be in poverty, but many are worthless and should not get money for their mistakes
Cool Hand Dave: If you read page one, you'll see that we've already been over most of this. :) Just because business people make a lot of money doesn't mean that they don't work as hard as other people. People just have this preconceived idea of lazy fat business people sitting in comfortable leather chairs all day and bossing people around. Oh yeah, and as I have been already told off for, this isn't a debate about capitalism vs. socialism. It's about the "differences between socialism and communism". :)
coolhanddave, you hit the nail right on the head. business execs may work hard, but they do not work any harder than teachers and construction workers who get paid XXXX. we need reform and we need it now
How many years did those construction workers go to College? Teachers should make more money... Florida has this nice thing called a class size amendment. Now we will double our schools and teachers to comply and pay hundreds of billions of dollars to do it. Ugh... I'd love to see more go to teachers, but here in Florida the liberals pushed that through and those pay raises are impossible. That amendment passed by 1%. Most people didn't know how much it would cost, and that is the only reason why it passed.   Business is not easy. As an executive you have to give your personal gurantee on financial statements or other important things. If something goes wrong you go to jail or pay huge penalties. You have to make the big decisions. That executive is usually the main strategist who is planning the company's entire future. That guy in the cubicle doesn't do that.   Seems to me that when you have a good CEO the company turns up and makes much more and people get a 5% pay raise. Nothing is wrong with rewarding the guy who doubled revenues.
Exactly! You use what you have left to try and get back off... the government doesn't help you. But if someone makes a stupid choice that they could easily have prevented the government rushes in to help them. It's not our fault that someone makes a stupid choice. So be it. Every great mistake has a halfway moment. They knew the risks.   I'm probably not that compassionate. If I ever get rich I'll give a lot for charity. Raising my taxes to 85% is unacceptable. When I give to charity I know where the money goes. When I give to the government some of my money ends up being spent on cattle research or paying some SEC people more than the president.   A business can set its pay as high as it wants... that money belongs to the company. The government needs to set limits because it isn't their money.   I have my own plans to deal with the problems: 1. Create a progressive tax rate that takes no more than 50% of anyone's money.  2. Create a free healthcare plan for anyone at or below a certain income level.  3. Reform welfare and don't hesitate to cut benefits if someone is being lazy.  4. Raise excise taxes on tabacco and alcohol products, luxury cars, and many other goods.  5. Provide more money for people at or below a certain income level to go to college.  Anyone can live the American dream. If someone's parents make stupid choices their kids don't have to. They can do well in school, go to a good college, and get a nice job.

As long as people have guns and are not robots that will never happen here in the United States. The IRS is the most hated branch of the government and they are not even close to collecting the same kind of taxes in Europe.  So don't let them take your guns!
Originally posted by fallingupwards  coolhanddave, you hit the nail right on the head. business execs may work hard, but they do not work any harder than teachers and construction workers who get paid XXXX. we need reform and we need it now    We don't need reform. Sound to me your really not ready to be a teacher. Poverty = teaching, accept it or find something else to do.  Through all of human history, when the divide between rich and poor and become too much. The poor simply kill the rich and take what they have. It has happened before, it will happen again. Don't worry the poor will take care of themselves. Oh as long as they have guns!  XXXXXX people = massive reform. Two hundred years for a government to be in business is a very very long time. If our free market system is truely injust it will not last.
listen my friend, if i was so money-hungry like broker i would never want to teach. but i really dont care about money. call me crazy, but i never want to be a millionaire. i want to make a serious contribution to society and enjoy my job at the same time (i'm a huge history person). but at the same time, i still need to make enough money to support a family. that is not too much to ask is it?  to be honest broker, i liked some of your reforms. i'm serious. they dont sound to capitalistic to me.
I like a mix, leaning toward capitalism.   I would also like to be a teacher, but I could never live on that salary. I plan to go into business, make my money, and if my career in politics doesn't take off, become a teacher...a history teacher. I love history!  I'm not money hungry. I want to live better than I do now, and I'm prepared to do something to make that happen. Not all people are.   And to those in other, less wealthy countries our poor are considered well off.
broker, if you want to teach then teach!!! c'mon man, money does not mean that much. you can live off 50,000 a year and still raise a family and live in a house. you dont need all that material stuff. do something that you would really enjoy, dont let money decide for you. i know this is very very cliche, but it is so true: money does not buy happiness
Teachers make $30,000 here. $50,000 is about 10-15 years into the job.
Falling doesn't think their healthcare is bad... XD
what is better: no healthcare because you cant afford it or descent healthcare for free?  you can easily live off 40,000 a year. that shouldnt be a problem, unless you have a huge desire for material things that never last. or you can become a teacher and make a real impact on society.
That decent healthcare would cost $100 billion, at least, and it we would have huge waiting lists, huge shortages, etc, etc.   I don't know if I could live off of that much money. At least half go to essentials, and then with two children and a wife...   And I wouldn't want to enter the school system at this point. I can not work with those... children. Times will change, though.
can you please site your sources when you say 100 billion? thanks.  i never said get rid of privatized health care. if you can afford it, then go to a private health care place. but if you cant, then free health care is well worth it.  since you are unwilling to become a teacher yourself, stop whining about the school system.
It was a report by a medical organization on why we should have free healthcare. I can't remember what I searched on Yahoo! to get it... it was by an organization wanting free healthcare, so I'd call it fairly accurate.   I am in the school system. Watch me whine.
i cant watch, but i can read
emoticon_rolleyes Fine, read me whine. Always with this and that...
Falling:  The trend I see in your post is that you advocate a mandatory and instutionalized charity for the poor. You basically advocate forced giving for people who have money. To me that just strikes too much of someone telling me what I must do against my will.  To really achieve social justice, a major shift in how humans view the poor is needed. A major shift in the morality and ethical treatment of the poor in this country will achive your vision of social justice.  Passing laws and government institutions do a very poor job of teaching ethics and morality to people. You are approaching the solution of poverty in this country from the wrong venue.  When was the last time the IRS, BATF, or FAA gave a lesson on the ethical treatment of the poor? When governments does try to teach ethics and morality it then becomes social engineering that rates up there with the Nazis.  When people finaly accept what the worlds religions have been teaching for thousands of years about care to the poor, will there finally be social justice, without socialism or government social engineering.
Government social enginering?  Risk of sounding like a broken record.  Another reason for not letting the government take your guns!
kelvin, if rich people gave then we would not have to have taxes. but the fact is that they dont, or they dont give enough. there's a bunch of money-hungry multi-billionaires out there who are competing to see who can have the most money. meanwhile, there are homeless people living all over the cities streets and single working mothers who cannot afford the basic necessities of life.  this may come as a shock to you, but i believe that the ultimate LONG-TERM goal should be anarchy or at least libertarianism. now you might be saying to yourself, "i thought falling was a supporter of big government". think to yourself: if our country went to anarchy or libertarianism, poverty would skyrocket and there would be total chaos. why? because people are not used to sharing their money with those who have not been as lucky or fortunate as them. that is why i think we need a strong socialist government now to instill the idea of sharing (which is a Christian principle) into the rich person's head. this will take at least a good 75 to 100 years of socialism. after this period, it will come naturally for the rich to give to the poor. government will become unnessesary except for law enforcement/defense and poverty will be eliminated.  you might laugh at my theory and label it as "idealistic", but thats ok. idealism can be good too:)
hell will freeze over before that happens
You can never kill greed. It wouldn't last.
ghetto, would you care to share with us what you think is the best government and why? and give some intelligent reasons, for a change.
Always insulting others and inserting words no one said... what skill!
Hmmm! The government teaching people to share? What office would that be called. The Department of Morality and Ethics? What happens if people don't measure up the governments yard stick of morality?  Once you build a govenment institution, it is almost impossible to make it just go away. Build a socialist infastructure and all you get is bigger and bigger government.  So after you achive the socialist government and finally build your long term goal of a libertarianism government, do you just say the country is now enlightened we don't need you any more?  Your not going to convince the rich to share the wealth with more laws or institutions. Government and socialism is about control. Once they have it you don't get it back.
Yes! With capitalism, you can be stupid or you can be smart. You can make the wrong choices or the right choices. Every great mistake has a halfway moment! Everyone has a chance...including those in poverty.
then explain to me why most people who are born in poverty, remain in poverty their whole life?? or vice-versa??  i believe that human behavior is shaped by our environment. john locke called this the "tabula rasa" or "blank tablet". everything we learn comes through experience. therefore, if an entire generation grows up in a socialist and cooperative environment, they will naturally be cooperative. there will always be a couple greedy people out there, but they will be a small minority because everyone grew up in a cooperative environment.  kelvin, suppose you are right when you say that the socialist government would be unwilling to give up their control. i would still take a socialist government over a capitalist government. and when i said that we would go from a socialist government to a libertarian government, i meant a gradual change probably covering a span of about 50 years. we are going through a gradual change as we speak, from capitalism to socialism. i wish the process would speed up, but nonetheless we are going through a gradual change.
We creating some social welfare programs, yes, but this country won't go socialist for a long time, and I hope it never does.
explain to me why most people who are born in poverty, remain in poverty their whole life?? or vice-versa??
Maybe because they either don't try to get a job, or they don't care. In America there is no excuse for being poor. There is equal opportunity for everyone. (If you're willing to work hard enough.)
so it is just a coincidence that the majority (over 50%) of people born in poverty remain in poverty their whole life? somehow i doubt that...
They can get out of it if they are willing to work hard enough! Many are not.
Originally posted by fallingupwards   because people are not used to sharing their money with those who have not been as lucky or fortunate as them. that is why i think we need a strong socialist government    What do you do with the people who don't agree with the government and don't want to share? Does the government "re-educate" them. Do you make them criminals? Or push their dead bodies into a secret ditch?   Doesn't sound like social justice to me. Then again a strong socialist government at that point could get away with anything, because citizens don't have guns.  Was it you that said, "With proper application of socialism you can defeat poverty" or something like it. Well does that also mean gun control.   Just answer me this one question: Can you have a socialist state without gun control?
Yeah, no matter how you conduct it there will always be resistance. Is it going to be a police state so things stay the same?
Broker:  Still afraid of guns? Because the only way the government is going to get away with high taxation is when they can take all the guns away from XXXXXX off people. Remember 1776 was all about taxes!  People like you are going to be the first in line for "re-education" when we get a socialist government.
But the great thing about this country is that we control the government. If the majority puts it socialist yours guns won't stop it.
yeah, we saw how well the tax-free Articles of Confederation did. it did very well...except for the fact that it was a complete failure.  anyway, i am a firm believer that the government should not control the media or the flow of ideas, even if we are in a socialist government. freedom of speech, religion, and press will always be very very important. i would much much rather have a capitalist government with free speech than a socialist government without free speech. free speech is more important than any governmental system.  we do not need to "re-educate" anyone. you claim that socialism would not work because there would always be resistance. well, what about resistance to capitalism. there are many many people out there who resist capitalism (like me:)). but there is no need to "re-educate" these wicked free-thinking radicals.   my point is there will always be some resistance NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF GOVERNMENT YOU HAVE. under a capitalist government, there will always be people who resist and the same goes for a socialist government as well
Who is calling for no taxes?
Originally posted by fallingupwards     my point is there will always be some resistance NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF GOVERNMENT YOU HAVE. under a capitalist government, there will always be people who resist and the same goes for a socialist government as well    I belive that is a supporting statement for small government. Big government = big taxes.  The Red Scare was unjust. But that is what government does, it meters out injustice. What you propose is making the 500lb gorilla of government we have into a 2000lb gorilla. It is not about capitalism or socialism, it is about runaway government. You socialist agenda simply pushes runaway government much further along than our current government.
Socialist or Capitalist? The end result is the same when the government gets too big and powerful. You have already seen the result of a runway capitalist government with the Red Scare. If our own government could have gotten away with kiling the socialist and hiding thier bodies in a secret ditch it would have. Communism was runaway socialism. When you give the government more money, more authority, more power, that is exactly what it does, it becomes a 2000lb gorilla.
Socialist governments are more likely to bail out business than our government, Falling. You're so anti-business...
i am anti-big business or anti-corporations. i am a supporter of small businesses. for example, there was a shopping center close to my home with a lot of small businesses. they were doing very good and then all of a sudden, Target (a large corporation) moves in. they take all of the business away and all of the small places go bankrupt. corporations destroy small business.
50% of small businesses never sell to the public, they sell to those big corporations.
i am mostly referring to small shops and stores that people run. simple partnerships and sole proprietorships
There's a Target store in the plaza near where I live. There are lots of small shops open around it and always have been...
i worked as a cashier at target for two years. so i would know. a small shop did not last for more than two months at that shopping center because target took all the customers away
THe small shops around Target here haven't shut down...
i swear man, a shop cannot stay there for more than a month or two. its in a rich part of town too.  broker, just freakin admit it. if a walmart or target moves into an area with a bunch of small shops, those shops profits are going to drop like crazy. and when profits decrease, the shops have to leave. why? because most of them are small sole proprietorships or partnerships. the owners cannot afford such losses.
I never said they didn't drop. I said the businesses aren't forced to close just because a big company moves in.
so if you owned a small shop and target moved in and took all of your business away from you, you wouldnt be forced to close? all of your profit will disappear and you'll be losing money. any shop that is not making a profit is going to close
A lot of times those businesses are speciality stores, not discount retailers. If I was looking for... I don't know... models and model glue would I go to Target or The Hobby Shop?
many times, discount retailers sell the same products as smaller stores but they are at a cheaper price because a small business has to charge more in order to stay open.  DISCOUNT RETAILERS TAKE BUSINESS AWAY FROM SHOPS. FACE THE FACTS, BROKER.  one of about a trillion examples: there was a cool small guitar store back where i'm from that was doing very well and was thriving. but then, all of a sudden, Guitar Center (a monsterous guitar store based in Atlanta) moves in across the street. try to guess what happened? if you have a brain at all, you would guess that the small guitar shop was forced to close because everyone wanted to go to Guitar Center.  walmart, target, home depot, lowes, harris teeter, etc etc etc are all taking customers away from small businesses. IT IS A FACT.
I am not arguing that business decreases, I am saying that it is not as bad as you make it sound. I'm a bit surprised... you would prefer those small businesses to companies that give billions of dollars to charities?
In business size matters. A big retailer can run much more efficiently because of scale. Efficiency = lower cost.  Keeping an unefficient business open is equal to saying we should be driving gas guzzling cars because there is someting worthy about inefficency.  There are lots of small shops doing a very brisk business because a small shop can produce a custom quality product that a large business can not.  One example furniture. You want average Joe furniture at a good price, go to Sam Levitz.  Want a truly hand finished piece of Shaker furniture? You have to go to a craftsman making pieces one at a time.  Both retailers are efficient in their own right and are worthy to be in business. Both could never compete with each other.
broker, if u believe in competition then you'll also support small businesses. small businesses provide the purest form of competition. corporations are usually either oligopolies or monopolies.
And they give back billions and billions. How much do those small businesses give back into programs or right into charities?
and oligoplies and monopolies drive prices up, which hurts consumers, which hurts the poor :)
They can't drive privce up with the snap of their fingers...if they do people would stop buying as much or switch to smaller companies, and that would hurt the large companies really bad.
but pure competition is more beneficial to the consumer
Sometimes. Large corporations could cut costs to stimulate buying and increase profits...
Major socialist countries are literally dying. Sweden is a socialist place, and it states in their constitution that their government's main purpose is to provide social welfare for the people. Their population is rising .02% because of people coming into the country. If that cuts, their population will be decreasing...sometimes it probably already has decreased because there are more deaths than births.
Falling doesn't think the people should be opressed. He doesn't think socialist countries should step into communism...already brought that up.
What would life be if it was just perfect? Where's the challenge?   There will always be those who want to change things...a socialist infrastructure is very hard to change. People rely on the government after that step in...and once you step in, the door almost completely shuts.
Somewhat agreed.   I have no problem with some limited social welfare. Right now things are a mess because people are too compassionate. I want to reform welfare and welfare workers shouldn't be afraid to cut people off if they don't need it...and if they are they shouldn't have that job. I have no problem with giving healthcare to those who can't afford it.   But this is not across the board. If you are not seeking work or to further your education and get a better job you can't get into any of my programs...
Vote for me for president in 2036, lol.
If I can win the nomination... I have it all planned out. I get my masters in business administration and join a company or start one. I stay there for about ten years. Then I use that business position to launch my race to be governership of Florida. If that's successful I'll try and stay for two terms and use that to launch into the presidential race.
Here is a thread where we can go at each others throats, so-to-speak. Which is the better ecnomic system: Capitalism or Socialism?
I ran some numbers and here is what I came up with....  If you had 1 billion dollars, and you spent $1,000 an hour. It would take you more than 114 years to spend the billion.   Obviously we don't need a ton of money to survive, but I think that if someone has the discipline to work hard enough and save that much money they should be able keep it. It goes with the verse "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread." Notice that it does not say "In the sweat of thy face shalt Joey eat bread." Here is where the principle of work for your own food starts, in Gen. 3:19, from the mouth of God Himself.
He's not scared. That has been proven in the other forum. I think he is just waiting for time to show itself so he can pick up another debate.

Falling~  The respect between us is mutual, and I believe derived from our disagreements, of which we have found another.  Some may indeed be gained by the transfer of a dollar from a rich to a poor person, that I do not contend. It is the means by which that dollar is trransferred that I question. Let me put it like this:  About three years ago I started my own business. I went completely broke in order to get myself started, and now I am making a decent income. Why should the government be able force me to give you some of my money in order to cover your hospitial bill?
Exactly! The government wasn't there for you, but they want more of your money to pay for other people's problems.
Dsa,  I concur in part, but would say that it is not the job of the government to force us to "work to help everyone." If you were to have emergency surgery and couldn't pay the bill all you would have to do is ask me to help and I would. That is how the society takes care of itself, not through welfare and medicare. Besides I believe that more of the dollar's value would be lost in the transfer from Joe Blow to government to Billy Boy, than if Joe Blow gave the money directly to Billy Boy. Would you not agree?
Forcing us to pay for other mistakes just gives me another reason not do to it. It's not your money, it's our money, and you aren't going to spend it well, you'll pay some guys at the SEC more than the president when they're only agenda at their first meeting was to set their salaries. If I have some money I want to go to a good cause, the first place I'd put it would not be our government. All our government combined wastes about 10- 20 billion on social security, medicare, and welfare fraud alone. These super compassionates run the welfare system and won't cut anyone's welfare...California one of the biggest waste states...
What does a strong socialist government do with people like Broker?  Re-education by the Department of Ethics and Morality? Concentratlion camps? Oh what the h*ll, there won't be very many people like Broker after 50 years of socialism, just shoot them and burry them in a secret ditch. No one will miss them.   Falling is that your vision of social justice?
It is our money. It is not the government's money. They waste enough and I don't want to give them more. They don't scare how they spend it, so I don't want to give it. If I have wealth I will share it. Gates, Morgan, Rockefeller, Carnegie, etc, etc, etc, etc. The government isn't taking 85% of my income to waste it. It can take some, but no more than half. Would you give money to the government or the Red Cross?  I don't know many people who are OK with unchecked government spending, but you just got in. You wouldn't mind if our taxes were raised to 99%...
I'm going to go to college for years to earn my business degree. I'm going to work hard and I'm going to build myself a huge house and buy a hybrid car and you aren't going to stop me. I want nice things. The poor guy might want nice things, but he didn't work hard in school and he wouldn't commit himself to working through college. His fault, not mine. I'm going to laugh at him as I drive by in my hybrid car into the gates of my mansion. I worked hard for all of this. You have done nothing and have almost nothing. Not my fault.   Tell me that's mean, but it's true.
Not all public schools...not mine anyway. Always with the spending complaints from some teachers...
I'd love to pay teachers more, but with what money?   You're going to work for the government. Government pays a lot less. I will work in the private sector with a company generating millions of dollars and we can set high salaries and get big bonuses if we do well with the company.
Abolish all taxes? Who is calling for that? That would be stupid. Abolish the minimum wage? This is a pure capitalist agenda, which is simply insane. There is no such things as 100% communist, socialist, or capitalist government. I have never heard anyone in the school system ever call for a pure capitalist system.   What do you have against corporations? US coroporations make the world go, period. Corporations give billions and billions to charities...them or their executives. Bill Gates created a 1 billion scholarship fund for to help those who couldn't afford College, and Microsoft sponsers the Duke TIP and many other educational programs. That is just one example!   On spending complaints I was talking about budget manners. Two of my teachers go on and on complaining about why we should ro shouldn't do this or that. They have every right to complain about their salaries.
Around 50% of ALL small businesses sell to those big corporations only and never the public.   You are in a university. If it is a public one, it is not wholly public. It does not mean all public institutions teach that, nor private ones, nor lower institutions.   Can anyone here claim they like every single principal of one system? I consider myself capitalist because I lean toward that system. Of course we have incorporated ideas from other forms of government. This is not a pure capitalist system and it will never be one. This is a mix leaning toward capitalism. Sweden is capitalist in economic matters...you refer to that country all the time, so so will I.   Teacher unions can be a very, very dangerous thing. They can't just walk off the job until they get higher pay. Local governments would just lower substitute teacher requirements and replace as many as they could for even less money and they would not be qualified to teach everyone. Teachers know the salaries are low, so they know what they are getting into. They can still make a difference in private institutions, which will pay higher.
If you are in a public institution you should sue over their textbooks. If they are completely capitalist you'd win for sure...it's like a public institution requiring everyone use only the Bible in a world religions class.
You would win if it's a public institution. You can't have an economics class where one system is taught as being the best and only way to do things. Any judge in their right kind would order that institution to change or lose federal funding. I would rule that way. Don't be so sure.
Falling,  Would you mind putting everything together for us, and giving us a quick overview of why socialism is better than capitialism? I just want the facts, not the arguments (those are sure to come later). Thx.
It's an opinion, not a fact, and not every institution is like that.
Falling,  I will follow your three points. Thx for answering the question without the arguments (which I now expect to hear :))  Economic Reasons: It goes unquestioned that a dollar is valued more highly by a poor person than a rich (and I speak from having been on both sides of the spectrum). I will not agrue with these reasons as you have presented them.  Humanitarian Reasons: I will point out here that it is "the LOVE of money is the root of all evil." Capitialism is based on freedom, not money. Capitialism stands for the idea that a man should be able to work and earn money and spend his money as he sees fit (at least that is how this capitialist sees it). I agree that a person should get paid for how hard he works. If you don't show up, you don't get paid (that's at least one problem with unions, but has nothing to do with this debate). Capitialism allows for bargining and compromise. If I bid on a job at XYZ, Inc. and Joe's Services bids $5 lower, a Capitialist society allows me to bargin and try to win the contract. If 1% of the populace controls 50% of the wealth, it probably means that the 1% was willing to sacrifice and work their backsides off for years in order to become wealthy (of course some people get wealthy through other means).  Religious Reasons: In Genesis 3:19 we read, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread..." Notice that it is God talking and he says that Adam is to work for his own bread, not for Joe Blow's bread (not that there was a Joe Blow to give it to). Also notice where Christ placed the emphasis during His earthly ministry. He blessed the widow who gave her last farthings to the church. He told the rich man to "go sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor." Never once will you find Christ saying that the government is to be the distributor of help to the needy. It is always the people or the church that God used to care for the "fatherless and widow in their affliction." It is my view that we don't need more government to help us solve the problem, we need less government. If the government were to stop being "god" in this country I think the number of will Joe Blows would skyrocket, and all the Billy Boys would be cared for quite nicely. Also remember that it is the duty of the church to care for the needy, not just the Joe Blows.
The government can't afford to start doubling salaries. Private sector pays more the public sector, period.  Businessman push millions of dollars around. Salaries are based on company performance. If they get revenues up 20%, they can expect a pay raise with it. That's why they make all the money...they make all the decisions that make the money. What company pays their executives billions of dollars?  If people want more pay they should prepare to enter the private sector instead of the public sector.
Falling,  Economic Reasons: Yes, I believe in the "no work, no pay" idea, and I don't care what anyone, let alone some bigshot executive, thinks. About the teachers, my grandmother (who lost her husband in Sept.) retired last summer. She worked in the same classroom for a ton of years (I forget how many at the moment, something like 30), and now she is able to support herself because she was careful to save for her retirement ("support" here includes trips to Europe and the like). Many teacher's problem is that they have joined a union and therefore cannot decide for themselves, where they will work, how many hours they will work, what their pay will be. One of the beauties of a Capitialist society is that the individual person is able to decide for himself what course he will take. I have choosen to be a small business owner for the time being, my grandmother chose to be a teacher, and we are both paid for the amount of time we work(ed). The prices may vary but the principle is the same: If you are willing to work, sometimes long and hard hours, you will be sucessful, whether you started out rich or poor makes little difference.  Religious Reasons: My proof comes from firsthand knowledge of 100s if not 1000s of Joes who have the money to help a Billy but don't because the felt that the government would provide for them anyway. Yes, the Bible says that murder and theft are wrong, but notice that both are within the legitimate authority of a government according to Romans 13. It is not the job of the government to make sure that everyone is perfectly equal, such a goal is impossible to reach so long as there are people willing to think for themselves.
The government is not a private business. The government already takes about half of what corporations make...that's plenty. Executives are the ones making the decisions that create those jobs and create that wealth. Government needs to respect the private sector that has made this country great. How much business will we lost if you had your way? Millions of job, billions in productivity...
Hey falling, when you get a chance would you respond here? I am quite interested in what you have to say. Thx.
I don't think it is... my government is there to defend me and let me go about my economic matters as I please. I don't like how socialism is always interfering with business (though I plan to enter the field, so...)! I can't stand government bailouts, which I would think you would oppose, and socialist governments are ALWAYS bailing out big business. Perfect example is Germany. The bailed everyone out whenever it was needed and they can't afford it now... crashing.
Falling,  Where do you see the Constitutional grant for the government to pay teachers? Government is not a help, it is what is in the way of a great (and Constitutional) nation. If we start taking government out instead of putting it in everytime there is a problem it is my belief that the success which defined us for many years will return.
Thank you for clarifying.   Those corporations are very generous. According to your friend Target, they give 2 million away every week. That's 104 million a year. That's a good amount for a discount retailer.
That is insane! No one is calling for an end to public education. Why would I have a view that would kill my education? Everyone who is serious about education can raise to be whatever they want. You don't have to be rich. Your fantasy world where everyone who is poor always stays poor is just that, a fantasy. ANYONE with the drive can raise up from wherever they are, MILLIONS of examples.
Falling,  But public education was existent in 1787 so even under Dsa's definition of the Tenth Amendment it was a right reserved to either the people or the States. The federal government has no business in education. If the federal government doesn't pay teachers, and it shouldn't, then the people who send their children to public school should.  One of the major problems with socialism is found in an experience I had not too long ago. As I stood in line at a grocery store I noticed the people just in front of me shuffling through several cards, but not just any cards - these were walfare cards. I stood there and watched them pay for their groceries in disgust. I don't mind helping the needy, but when it is forced on me by the government I get mad. If the people had just turned around and asked if I could help them pay for their groceries I would have been more than happy to, but such was not the case. This is the effects of socialism in their true state, and I am one who does not wish that on anyone.
Falling,  You missed the whole point of my story. I was not disgusted at the poor people I was disgusted at the government under a socialist mindset. I love poor people, heck I was one for a while (and really kinda still am).  The families paying the teachers is certainly better than the federal government doing so. The Constitution is the "supreme law of the land" and as such should be followed in all circumstances. I would go for the State governments paying the teachers just so long as it took it out of the hands of the federal government, where it doesn't belong.  There is an old maxim, "You tax what you want less of, and subsidize what you want less of." Under this principle the federal government wants more poor people because it is taxing incomes and subsidizing welfare, and it is a socialistic philosophy that is behind this action.
Teacher salaries aren't going to change for awhile, and that's not going to cause a huge failure in an education system where students aren't motivated anyway. We should be more like Japan with education.
Debategirl,  Easy solution...don't come here! You don't like it, don't read it.  Falling,  Let the State government take care of the poor families if you just have to have governmental involvment, but my personal opinion is that the church should be providing for the needy, education is included.
The church? When did you arrive at that?   There was going to be a nice increase in teacher salaries down here, but that class size amendment passed...it's great to want smaller classes, but we will have to double the number of classrooms and double the number of teachers. Pay here will only go down because of that stupid choice, which most students actually opposed. I would love to pay teachers more...but here they're going to be getting even less because of votes who didn't know the huge cost of the plan.
Falling,  If the church decides to open a private affiliated school to educate its members kids I would have no problem with that, but when I said "that the church should be providing for the needy" I was mainly talking about financial assitance. Muslims have their mosks, Jews their tabernacles, and Atheists the State. Everyone can be helped, but that help should not come from the Federal Government, it is a violation of the Constitution and it is socialism that drives the Federal Government to provide for such things.
:eek: That old document was made to be changed, so it you aren't happy, change it. What? You didn't get enough votes? I think we're fairly happy with that 214 year old piece of paper!  Attacking the constitution... I have lost all hope for you.
Well, you don't have it... hope you're happy.
Falling,  Did I say that "the church ALONE provides for the needy?" If I did please point it out to me. Each religion has its own place to turn, but none of them should ever be able to turn to the Federal Government. The Constitution gives certain delegated powers to the Federal Government and handing money out for educational purposes is not one of them. Socialism is merely the stepping stone into Communism, and I don't want to see this nation start down that path.  Maybe I live by the Constitution because it is "the supreme Law of the Land." The question is not why do I live by the Constitution, but why don't you? Until the Constitution is replaced it will govern this land, and I plan to live by it.
Yeah, raise taxes to 85% so we can pay for everyone who's poor.   THe great thing about America is that the government isn't so intrusive. Sad to say that is dying because of the Liberals, and the day all of that has changed will be the day I lose my love for this country.
Originally posted by fallingupwards  oh no!! broker has threatened to stop loving this country if we help the poor!! we better go back to capitalism!!    You will never help the poor with a socialist system. The first casuality of a socialist state is the spirit of charity. The concept of charity in European societies does not exist, because it is the government job to the help the poor.  Government officials just don't strike me as being natural care givers. What then happens is you get a token "official" who pretends to give a rats pututie for carring about the poor, to make all the heartless people in a socialist state feel good that the government is doing something.
Yeah, you have to make them feel good or they won't want you taking 85% of their income.
Falling,  I am sorry you don't care for the Constitution, but "believ[ing] our country needs reform" is not, in my mind, a justification for such views. I too believe this country needs reform but you don't see me ignoring the Const. If you really feel strongly about your position, which I doubt not that you do, then I would suggest you write you Congressional representatives and express your concerns, other than that, and moving out of the country, I don't think you have too many other options. Further, what does the rejection of our Constitution have to do with not liking Capitialism?(And you still haven't responded to the first part of my last post.)
Lets look at the history.  Socialistic countries have failed because of poor economy.  Not so with capitalism.  How could a socialistic country help the poor. History shows that Socialism creates poor.  Welfare has been proven to make people reliant on the government. Government needs to spend more money.  Higher taxes. Economy suffers and more people become poor.  Capitalism has worked in the past.  Look at England before Industrial Revolution lots of poor.  After Industrial Revolution England rich less poor.  Let's remember the important ecomonic principle Trade creates Weath. Aid creates taxes and more poor.
Germany and Sweden have horrible economies right now.   Great Britain recently started moving toward socialism and their poverty rate is higher than ours and rising.
I am a new reader of this forum, which I see has lots of activity. I was just wanting to add my own comments, and hopefully cause some people to think critically about some of the issues brought up...I had to put two posts for character limit.  fallingupwards made a post:  <why do i prefer socialism over capitalism? i would like to break it down into three sections: economic reasons, humanitarian reasons, and religious reasons.  Given this opening, what follows then is not a summary of facts why socialism is superior to capitalism, but why one individual FEELS that it is better.  <Economic reason: utility theory teaches us that it is more economically efficient if we divide the wealth more equally. one dollar is worth more to a poor person than it is to a rich person, correct? no one can deny that fact. one dollar is not worth as much to a rich person as it is to a poor person. therefore, if we distribute the wealth more equally, we will be using our resources MORE EFFICIENTLY by giving it to those who value them the most.  I would like some more explanation of this.   It sounds as if the reasoning for taking a dollar from a richer person, and giving it to a poorer person originates in the idea that a poorer person will utilize the dollar in a more productive fashion (more utility) than a richer person. The cases can be made on both sides here.  One side would say that the rich person will spend the dollar on a cigar and burn it up while the poorer person will buy essentials. The other side says that the rich person will invest the dollar to produce and the poorer will buy booze.  I would like to know how the mere act of re-distribution solidifies the former of the two scenarios as the result.  The obvious conclusion is that the poorer must be in a position that essentials are not provided by their own income. If this is the case, our modern (not pure) system of capitalism temporarily provides, through public and private channels, for essentials, to people unable to obtain them on their own. The current system is set up to help people provide for themselves and eventually become a supplier of essentials for others and so on and so forth. This system is in place and practical today.  In the socialist practice, which is historically different than the socialist theory, essentials are provided by re-distribution of wealth, which causes a decrease in over-all production - Soviet Union, North Korea, et all. The effects are that the poorer become equal with the rich, and productivity decreases, causing a stagnated growth in utility. So while everyone in a socialist system has the same utility, over time that utility is exponentially smaller than even the lowest levels of utility caused by the modified capitalist system.  One way to look at it is...over time, socialistic systems increase productivity very slowly for all peoples equally. Capitalistic systems increase productivity at huge rates, first for those able to benefit the most (the wealthy) and then later for those who did not have sufficient investment in the system to benefit (the poor). Think of the cost of living in America. Essentials AND amenities have become cheap enough that the poor, while very far below the standards of the rich, or very far above the standard of the poor 75 years ago.  Conversly, those 75 years were all it took for practical socialism to crumple and fall, destroying both rich and poor alike in the Soviet Union.  <Humanitarian reason: socialism is clearly more moral than capitalism. have you ever heard of that saying: "money is the root of all evil"? well, money is the foundation of capitalism. that should tell you a lot about capitalism. lets look at this logically: 1. money is the root of all evil 2. money is the foundation of capitalism 3. therefore, capitalism is evil another reason to dislike capitalism from a humanitarian standpoint is the fact that ONE PERCENT OF OUR NATION OWNS HALF OF THE TOTAL WEALTH. how is that moral? how is that ethical? i'm not saying that everyone should get paid the same amount. but the wealth needs to be distributed more equally. you should get paid according to how much work and effort you put into a job. in this case, teachers would make the same amount as most businessmen. also, PURE capitalists believe that the minimum wage should be abolished. this is very very very unethical and immoral.  This assertion is as illogical as the notion that your statements are the "facts" the show socialism superior to capitalism.  Although I do share the sentiment that it is very sad that 1% of the nation owns 50% of the wealth, and it is perhaps un-ethical, that does not mean that the fault lies in the wealthy. Too often arguments like this one, which is premised on an incorrect logical process, are used in a sort of class-warfare argument against capitalism.  The wealth is there, wether it is in the hands of the wealthy or the poor. As previously noted, maximum utility is not a foregon result of redistribution of wealth. Because, thank God, all peoples have free will and choice to do with our posessions as we will.  However, where class warfare loses its substance is in the underlying notion that the wealthy attempt to prevent the poor from progressing into the wealthy "class" on such false "facts" that the wealthy just don't want competition. It is true that devices like Monopolies benefit from being the "King-of-the-Mountain," but these devices are regulated and not allowed in our, note again, MODERN, NON-PURE, PRACTICAL capitalistic system. There are still some missing regulations to prevent the wealthy from using their power to suppress the poor...an immoral and un-ethical action, yes. But the idea that merely because the wealthy are wealthy, the system is un-ethical is as baseless as the logical process you presented.  The premise of your argument is that "money is the root of all evil." I think someone censored your Bible, because mine reads, in Timothy 6:10 "For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."  Note that the LOVE OF money is the root of all evil. The love of money is akin to the act of the wealthy hording money and preventing the poor from attaining it. This scripture tell us that this action is immoral, erring from the faith. This is true.  So, regulations should be in place to stop the wealthy from preventing the poor to attain wealth, but that is not the same as regulations which re-distribute the wealth blatantly, which itself is an immoral act. Wether you take my money, or the government took my money to give to you, it was still stealing. I would rather give of my own accord to help my fellow man, because it is not only moral, but righteous.
<Religious reason: being a Christian, religion is obviously very important to me and is reason enough to believe that one system is better than the other. this might not be the case for you guys (i dont know if you're a Christian or not). but nonetheless, it is very important to me. Jesus taught over and over again that the rich should share their wealth with the poor. he said this through parables and the beatitudes and many other instances. it is quite clear that Jesus had compassion on the poor. MOST (and notice i did not say all) rich people do not share a lot of their money with the poor, relative to how much they really make. therefore, since the rich are not giving to the poor as much as they should, we need government to redistribute the wealth for them. if the rich gave enough to the poor, then we wouldnt have this problem. but they dont. we need government.  I am a Christian too. I very passionately support the idea of giving to the needy. Jesus Christ, our Saviour and our example which we should all strive to live like, was infallible, without sin, the Son of God.  Our government, which has brutally construed the idea of seperation of Church and state, is in no way infallible, and is more sinful than any thousands of humans could ever be. The Bible teaches that we are to strive to be as Jesus was and is. In light of this, I think our (those of us striving for righteousness) responsibility should be left to us, and not passed on to the government.  My case on this was solidifed when I saw the work of a publicly-funded artist(being supported by a government program for artists). All of his work was sacreligous and one item was a sculpture of Christ on the cross...upside down in a large vat of real urine. We DON'T need government. We need people to have compassion, reason and accounability.  Your case that very few rich share their money with the poor is very valid, and I share it and condemn those that horde money and live lavishly while others struggle for necessities. However, I believe legislation should exist so that those that ARE charitable can have less taken from them by the government.  This would be a better way to encourage those that are wealthy that giving is beneficial, rather than just encouraging the cycle that seems to be these peoples' minds. IE: I make a lot of money, government takes much more, so I need to make much more, government takes more etc. etc.  I forget the scripture now, and cannot find it(if you can, please let me know) that reads: [paraphrasing] "The task of the righteous man is to serve God and to give openly, the task of the un-righteous is to horde wealth to give it up to the righteous man."  I don't know about you, but I would rather exist in a system where the righteous are allowed to profit freely while still serving God and able (and hopefully willing) to give.  In this regard, many, if not all, historical socialistic systems have been secularized, not allowing the notion of God on the premise that the being of God is impossible according to dialectic philosophy. So the government, historically corrupt, plays the role of God - determining what is righteous and what is true - according to the needs of society. Even the socialists recognize the idea that society needs God, but they attempt to play the role, rather than let individuals strive for the role and exemplify righteousness to each other.  While I don't believe our system is infallible, I believe it is far superiour to socialism, by the arguments I have laid out. Please let me know your feelings on these issues.
The first thing that happens in socialism is a huge drop in charitable giving and a rise in poverty.

I hope you don't mistakenly think that I was arguing FOR socialism. I was refuting some assertions made by another member posting FOR socialism, and I included that member's statements in my post, followed by my ideas and thoughts on them.  I only had time to glance at that site you posted. I will have to look into it more later.
Please excuse my short attention span. It was a long post.
I would also like to address a common statistic used to demonstrate that capitalism only helps the richest.  http://www.armory.com/~rstevew/WealthDist_TheNation.pdf  The statistic I found was that in 1998, the richest 1% of the population owned 38.1% of the wealth. If someone else can post a more current statistic, please do so...it does not matter, as this statistic is irrelevant based on the observations below:  The "wealth" of this study is explicitly stated to include ALL assets like houses, bank accounts, and (this one is very important) stock portfolios. A stock portfolio, remember, contains all market assets like mutual funds, index funds, and stocks of individual companies.  Now, Let's take a hypothetical example of a billionare like Warren Buffet...whose "wealth" fluctuates with the market, but is stated to be near 30 billion. (A nice note about this guy: His "value investing" style mirrors his lifestyle and overall philosophy on life: he doesn't live in a huge house, he doesn't collect cars, and he doesn't take a limousine to work. In fact, "The Oracle of Omaha" lives in the same house he once bought for $31,500. Wish he could teach the Hollywood elitist liberals a thing or two.)  A man like Warren Buffet is worth 30 billion, but remember that this worth is houses (apparently 31,500), bank accounts, and stock portfolio. Let's say the house value is essentially nothing. So his 30 billion is split between bank accounts and stock assets, maybe 50/50. (Although I doubt a man with the investment genius like Buffet has anything less than 80% in stocks).  50% of 30 billion is 15 billion. In stocks. Stocks like Coca Cola, American Express, and Gilette.   Last year, Coca Cola spent $7 billion dollars in expenses. Do you know where that $7 billion goes? Into the pockets of employees, to small business that sell them bottling equipment, and to their various franchises and subsidiaries.  Gilette spent $7.2 billion.  And American Express spent $21 billion in the same way.  As an owner of stock in these companies, Buffet owns percentages of the company. A man like Buffet can own a powerful 5-10% even.  So, if Buffet is forced to give a percentage of his wealth away, that means he has to liquidate some of it, sell stock. He looks and sees that his Coca Cola stock is the least impressive, so he sells his 5% of it to pay for the "tax"/"robbery".  5% of $7 billion = $350 million. I hope you're going to explain to those employees and suppliers of Coca Cola why it is your taking $350 million away from them.  If this money were put to welfare, you are essentially laying off employees and taking away business from other suppliers (who may, in turn, have to lay off employees), to give money to the un-employed, of which you have now created more.  So now welfare is again inadequate and the cycle has to continue, until everyone is dependent on the government welfare checks, all of which are inadequate.  But if you follow the fundamental capitalistic idea of "You make what you earn for yourself" everyone has their own power to raise or lower their income at their choosing. Some may have to work harder at it than others...but such is life. And even if it might hurt some peoples' feelings, it is the best thing to do.
Dude:  You need to go to the commie sites. I've been there for only one day and I am totally shock by the lack of riggour in their arguments. After one day I have been restricted to only one section of the site.
Hey Stormin Norman:  Did you get banned again? I haven't seen you on the commie site after 2 posts.
And yet another post from me. This time with an interesting statistic similar to the "wealth" statistic, only this one is a bit more meaningful.  Total income tax share (percentage) by highest wage-earners:  Year: Total........Top 1%...Top 5%...Top 10%..Top 25%..Top 50% 1986: 100.00......25.75......42.57......54.69......76.02......93.54  1987: 100.00......24.81......43.26......55.61......76.92......93.93  1988: 100.00......27.58......45.62......57.28......77.84......94.28  1989: 100.00......25.24......43.94......55.78......77.22......94.17  1990: 100.00......25.13......43.64......55.36......77.02......94.19  1991: 100.00......24.82......43.38......55.82......77.29......94.52  1992: 100.00......27.54......45.88......58.01......78.48......94.94  1993: 100.00......29.01......47.36......59.24......79.27......95.19  1994: 100.00......28.86......47.52......59.45......79.55......95.23  1995: 100.00......30.26......48.91......60.75......80.36......95.39  1996: 100.00......32.31......50.97......62.51......81.32......95.68  1997: 100.00......33.17......51.87......63.20......81.67......95.72  1998: 100.00......34.75......53.84......65.04......82.69......95.79  1999: 100.00......36.18......55.45......66.45......83.54......96.00  2000: 100.00......37.42......56.47......67.33......84.01......96.09   As you can see, this shows that the top 1% of wage-earners pay 37.42% of taxes paid in this country. Taking that number to just the top 5% accounts for more than half of all income taxes paid.  Keep in mind, this statistic differs from the 1% wealthiest because these are income tax numbers. So this top 5% is not necessarily the top 5% wealthiest people, but rather the top 5% of income earners. That's the working class...not the wealthy living off of their fully purchased assets.  So, in the current tax system in America, you are punished for WORKING more, not necessarily for HAVING more. Starting to understand why we're called the lazy land of excess?
fallingupwards, I'm eager to hear your responses...I've made a couple of meaty posts here and I want to know what you think of them and what your cases against mine are.
Originally posted by dsadevil  Sure, but unfortunantly too few joe blows are willing to give up money for the amount of billy boys there are, and its impossible to match up the willing joe blows with needy billy boys on a large scale, and often the joe blows who can afford to give (assuming they are willing) are not in contact with the billy boys who need the gift. If people, as a whole, were as altruistic and kind as you purport, government would be unnecessary, and we'd naturally become rather utopian in a pseudo communist sort of way. But we aren't that kind, thus the need for government mandate.    On this note, I have this opinion:  The government's role is NOT the provide for the poor.   The preamble reads "We the people, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice and ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."  Our government was formed to establish justice (make laws), ensure domestic tranquility (police), provide for the common defense (military), promote the general welfare (help the poor).  And since you all are actually thinking now, look at the word PROMOTE the general welfare. Note that immediately preceding is PROVIDING for the common defense. The government should fit the whole bill for the military, but the government's job is NOT to fit the bill for general welfare...that is up to each citizen.  Government should take the role of PROMOTING general welfare by allowing easy access to work for those that need it, encouraging citizens to give to the poor, and disallowing the rich from preventing the poor to attain wealth.

Since everyone seems to have forgotten this thread, I'll just keep posting in the hopes that someone reading through and not posting will still be able to encounter some of these viewpoints.  What is the GDP/citizen?  China? $838/person. N. Korea? $900/person.  Admittedly that is not ALL due to socialism, but a large part of it.  In addition, explain to me the mistakes that were made during the communist revolutions in the countries like Soviet Union and China. More importantly explain to me (and write a book) the remedies to these problems?  This is the main problem with many socialists. It's easy to support an idea that hasn't come to fruition. The blank page will never answer back to you.   It also takes a very large amount of arrogance to assume that YOU understand Marxist socialism better than, say, the founders of the Soviet Union.  Most socialists read the manifesto once, read a bunch of Hegel and conclude that they've got it all figured out.  The good news for us capitalists is that we don't need to study socialism in depth to refute it. Because very intelligent people in other countries have already done so and brought about the death of socialism on their own - because even all these scholars put together couldn't create a viable working model of it.  Socialism is nice on paper, but in the real world, it has no merit.

Regardless of your politics at this particular site. If stupidity makes you sick, then bring a barf bag.
Cut and dry, what you earn you keep= capitalism What you earn you get a little piece of = socialism. Now why would you ever have the motivation to become more than an average worker, a janitor, cashier, whatever, rather than a doctor, or a scientist. A doctor or a scientist takes years of study, dedication and hard work, anyone can be a cashier.  So if a cashier makes the same as a teacher, or a doctor, or a scientist, why take the hard route?  Human nature is what human nature is, and while I would like to believe that the majority of people are good, many who would be quite happy to suck of the system and do their meager amount of work and live as well as any other person. In socialism there is no motivation to succeed. There is no drive to better oneself because no matter what you do to improve your standing, you never improve your surroundings, lifestyle, or anything else.  In a capitalist society the drive to succeed is everywhere. You want a better car? Get that raise by working harder and you can have it. Get that degree, work at the university you can have it. You want a house in the country so you can give your kid a pony that you always wished you could have, put that overtime in, keep your nose to the grindstone, show your boss what an asset you are and you can have it. You have an idea? Get a patent, start your own company and generations of your lineage can live quite nicely for the work you've put in.  Why should the guy sitting on the porch doing nothing profit from your work when he's done nothing to better himself or add his knowledge to society?  Capitalism forces people to excel. In such a society such as the US has is it any wonder why even the poor here live better than many rich in other countries?
This is my first post here, so keep the flames etc to a minimum. I just wanted to briefly mention something that i havent seen mentioned here before. Aside from the most previous post, which i agree with fully, id like to add this: All one hears from those pushing socialism, communism etc, (sorry for the generalization) is that the wealth should be spread out evenly and accordingly. That the wealthy in the US are evil, and this extreme minority is stereotyped to be completely homogenous. To a certain extent I can understand how everyone plays an important role in society, and that perhaps not everyone is "greedy" and is only looking for a high paying job etc. but the point I am looking to make is: more often than not, in a capitalistic society, a simplistic approach to becoming successful and wealthy one makes sacrifices and in the process must take risk. Bear with me if this is not yet fully obvious and makes sense.  i.e. (just some improvised examples thanks to what ive read on this forum so far) a person going into the vocation of a teacher must goto school, get an appropriate degree, etc etc. Its likely that getting hired should not be that difficult/ take that long, and he/she will recieve a steady wage and the teacher will not worry excessively that perhaps he/she wont get paid this week or whatnot. what I am trying to point out is that this lifestyle and furthermore transaction of monetary value is steady/ no extreme fluctuation, not too stressfull of a lifestyle given that the person knows what they are getting themselves into.  now to counter that, heres an opposite spin: that same person decides not to goto school, and wants to become a real estate investor. due to the funds that would have gone for tuition he/she can now invest/buy in an apartment building. right off bat there is SO much more risk involved in this. for all we know, all the tenants leave b/c the area gets bad, the owner cant pay the taxes or pay the mortgage off, and the building gets repossessed. but say for instance that there is a demand for apartments in that area, the owner raises rent, renovates the building with that money, and is able to put that money into another purchase of a house..... the persons in the end has made some significant change $$  point being tho that in all walks of life, it should be common sense that people usually, i stress usually because there are always rare exceptions, are capable of making a better living because they are also in the risk of living poorly very fast, a lot is on the line. As the stock market saying goes, the more risk, the more gain, the more loss.   How can one say that this wealth should be distibuted evenly, when the risk for acheiving this wealth is Never distributed evenly. I know im gonna get killed for this, but someone who has nothing, has nothing to lose, he/she can only gain something. On the flipside, one with a lot, has a lot to lose, but likewise is more able to make a lot.  Sorry for the long post, and i hope it makes sense, its 4am here ;)
Most of the people protesting for peace are protesting for communism, the most violent and oppressive form of government imaginable. Did you know that Saddam Hussein is a socialist? The Baath Party is a socialist party. We should have known we would have to defeat him later, based on this alone. However, the desire for retribution, with respect to Iran, caused us to step out of character and act opposite to the norm at that time.   Some of the worst scumbags imaginable have been socialists. No wonder some people are so quick to defend the man. No wonder he allowed a British socialist to interview him. No wonder the Workers World Party is funding antiwar protests. No wonder France, Germany, China, and Russia are defending him. No wonder the democrats are attacking the president first and aligning themselves with these anti-American forces. Socialists are too transparent.
You need look no further than the current state of California to realized that the United States is heading towards socialism just as Europe has in the past few decades. Will the United States one day become a socialist nation? Does socialism work? Would avoiding socialism hurt the future of the US or would socialism hurt the future of the US?
Hopefully we'll change California for the better if we get it back... we see what happens in liberal experiments... they go horribly wrong.  I don't think we will ever embrace European socialism. Our own limited brand, maybe, but nothing like what you see in Scandinavia. And that's probably best for America.

Yes California is following European socialism. Just like socialist Europe, they are going broke. Socialism depends on large income taxes to fund social programs. Try the same taxes here in the USA and people will get thier guns and shoot all the politicians trying to tax them. Remember this country was born over a fight over taxes.

I think the sitution in California is getting even worse with giving illegals a license. The next thing you know the illegals will have the right to vote! Grey Davis was a huge mistake and will go down as an absolutely horrible leader for what he has done both now and before his recall.  Californias attempt as socialism is an example to us all though. We cannot allow ourselves to go the way of Europe because we will end up in the same situation they are in. The democrats have to get their heads on straight and the conservatives need to stop their excessive spending programs as well. We need to avoid another California or Europe incident.
i stated this elswhere in the forum... don't remember where.  the u.n. was doing a world study of something that i don't remember, but it involved going to every capital city in the world. when it came time to visit washington d.c. (which was one of the last in the study) a russian, i believe, in the study, told a congressman that washington d.c. was the most socialist cities in the world.  sorry, i'm rust on explaining that story... most escapes me.  Interesting, but anything UN related is questionable unless I can see more than what you have given here. I'd like to know why he thought DC was very socialist and how Beijing or Havana could have been less socialist than DC when they are communist.
This is the most interesting article I've ever read about Communism. I never really understood what Communism really was before. I used to think that it sounded good in principal, but now I see that it sounds insane and scary even in principal.  If you have any interest in the subject, this is an amazing article.  http://www.summit.org/resources/HeartMindSoulofCommunism.htm
I agree with Alan Greenspan and other Libertarians. In the Book Capitalism, by Ayn Rand, Alan concludes that the only way a monopoly can exist is via government action. In fact, I contend that the more regulations there are, fewer companies will compete.
I agree with Alan Greenspan and other Libertarians. In the Book Capitalism, by Ayn Rand, Alan concludes that the only way a monopoly can exist is via government action. In fact, I contend that the more regulations there are, fewer companies will compete.  I read that book quite some time ago. Isn't it funny that Alan Greenspan is working for the 'biggest' monopoly in the world?  Although he does reccomend that all major government programs go through a sunset, even the Federal Reserve. Although I don't think this will ever happen. They'll probably collapse and blame 'capitalism', like they did in the past.   I merely hope that us 'liberty-minded' folks have some sort of place in this world, even if it's a state or two; so perhaps we can dule the pain of the forced destruction that's imposed on the whole of our economy. Regulations here and there, just continuely resonate the given culture, which would rather use force then reason.
Wow Rick, you said that great. I agree.
This is a nice debate.  You know, I'm not sure if I agree that when there is absolutely no gov. intervention in business there will never be a monopoly. Maybe not a 100% monopoly, but when has there ever been that (outside public utilities)?  Usually when you are talking about a monopoly, you are talking about one company or product becoming so widely used that there is eventually no real competition. Or, you could be talking about the malignant monopoly where the big company makes it to where only their product can be sold and only at the price set by them. Then they turn around and buy out or intimidate the competition out of business. I really don't see how that can't arise when there is no gov. involvement.   I like to consider myself mostly libertarian. I agree that there should be as little government in business as possible, but in the case of trusts/monopolies, that's where the gov. should be involved.   Googling Alan Greenspan and libertarian (because when someone called him a libertarian I said 'huh?') I got this: http://www.lewrockwell.com/latulippe/latulippe12.html  You know, I think it may just be that the US economy has been kept afloat merely by the Fed Reserve being run by someone who originally opposed it. Otherwise, it might have been sunk by the national debt a long time ago. (note: i think it's obvious I'm no economist.)

I do not believe in copyrights, and I can understand peoples sentiments against them. I do not perceive them to be an individual right.    I like to consider myself mostly libertarian. I agree that there should be as little government in business as possible, but in the case of trusts/monopolies, that's where the gov. should be involved.   At what point do you deem them a monopoly? When it's a 100% of the market in a town, region or country? I don't believe there's ever been one (devoid of government funds/support) that encompassed the country.  Googling Alan Greenspan and libertarian (because when someone called him a libertarian I said 'huh?') I got this: http://www.lewrockwell.com/latulippe/latulippe12.html  Objectivist at one point. Libertarian, I don't know.   You know, I think it may just be that the US economy has been kept afloat merely by the Fed Reserve being run by someone who originally opposed it. Otherwise, it might have been sunk by the national debt a long time ago. (note: i think it's obvious I'm no economist.)  He's leaving soon. He's been there twenty odd years, and he said to some degree that he doesn't know how to do his job. It's odd that no one wants to faze out this monopoly.
How does less regulation increase then number of companies?   I don't think I asserted this, and I wouldn't say regulations...perhaps taxes.  Without strong regulation, what is stopping a company from simply stomping competitors out of the market and achieving government hands off monopoly?   Is this something you have seen before or is it something you believe will happen?   Alcoa, I believe, once had a fairly big share of the metal market, but there was always a competitor out there keeping Alcoa busy. Again, I can't, and I won't fight for copyright companies/issues.  Large corporations are essentially are a antithesistical system to capitalism.   I don't see a capitalism definition as isolating to 'large corporations'.      Walmart practices a nasty form of competition removal by drastically lowering prices to decimate every competitor for 5 miles before jacking the prices up significently.  Many businesses do this, I think it's just a matter of competition. If they all just had the same prices, then they wouldn't compete.     I don't think anyone needs a lesson in how Microsoft operates. SO was notorious for buying out, illegally often, competitors.   I don't agree with Microsofts right to an idea. Although you can quote that as a negation to regulation in my books.   Lots of regulation is obviously bad for captialism, but so is little regulation, it appears like everything in this world, that moderation must be achieved for a happy existance.  I don't like vague ideals, as they are often dangerous. If they can be defined and looked at they can be proven and supported. I'd much rather hold the skeptical view, which is force is unneccessary.
 Googling Alan Greenspan and libertarian (because when someone called him a libertarian I said 'huh?') I got this: http://www.lewrockwell.com/latulippe/latulippe12.html   That was great PNAC. In the book Maestro, I read (I think it was that book) that he considers himself a libertarian. Another great libertarian economist is Nobel Prize winner Milton Freedman.   You know, I think it may just be that the US economy has been kept afloat merely by the Fed Reserve being run by someone who originally opposed it. Otherwise, it might have been sunk by the national debt a long time ago. (note: i think it's obvious I'm no economist.)  You are a better economist than most. I think the reason we can run such huge deficits is because money is being depreciated (we have inflation). The money is worth less because more is printed. How much is that dollar worth if there are only 10 in the world? How much would it be worth if there are 10 billion in the world? It would be worth less in the second example.  Greenspan believes the primary cause for inflation is the Federal Debt. He has a meeting with each President that comes into office and tells them this is what he believes. Notice how interest rates became nill under Clinton. He said that Clinton understood what he said, and lowered the deficit. Clinton was rewarded with prosperity created by low interest rates.   Great Post BTW.
How does less regulation increase then number of companies?  .  Most corporations don&#8217;t like regulations, so they say. Regulations benefit the larger corporations. How??? Because of scale, compliance takes less resources per revenue dollars.   For instance, it is takes more per capita recourses for a 10-person company to comply with a regulation than a 100,000-person company.  Example: Every company must comply with Federal Withholding Taxes. The guy that runs a small 3 man shop must pay an accountant to do the statements and whatnot. The large corporation spends less per employee for the same procedure because of scale.   It is that way with pretty much every regulation. The little guy must figure out comply with all of them. Does he need to hire accounts, attorneys or specialists? It can become complicated.  You mentioned corporate welfare (we both agree there) on another thread. That is a hot topic with me. The large corporations can hire the attorneys and specialists to file and get the &#8220;free money&#8221; thus freeing up money to help put the little guy out of business. We will end up with just a few large corporations in the end.
Speaking of monopolies:  Why can&#8217;t a monopoly exist? It can if it is created via the government. Patents create monopolies.  It is very difficult for them to exist in a free market. Here is why: Lets say you lower your prices to put the competitor out of business. Lets say you lower them so low that you lose money. You sustain that for some time until you are the only company left doing whatever it is you do.  The natural goal of a monopoly is to raise prices. You do so. Soon there is huge profits to be reaped. Others see your profits and want to join in. Capital is shifted into competing with your business. Well, you sold at a loss for years to put your competition out of business. You can&#8217;t do this forever. Now you are competing against others that did not carry the years of losses you did in creating your monopoly.    Monopolies can be good also. Standard Oil is an example how trust busting can fail the society. It may have set back alternative fuel research. There is no reason to investigate alternative forms of energy if gasoline is so cheap. How can other forms of alternative energy compete? If Rockefeller was allowed to keep his monopoly, and allowed to raise the price of gas, other people would have investigated alternative forms of energy. What do they say &#8220;Gasoline is cheaper than bottled water&#8221;? Why switch?  That is my opinion.
 What forms of regulation do you support?  I think there should be some environmental regulations. Companies should not be allowed to just dump poisons into the environment. The states should have some regulation in this regard. If there is a dispute amongst the states, then the Feds should help sort it out.  That is about it, I think.
 Alcoa has been getting it's butt kicked not because of metal, but because of Glass and to a lesser degree Plastic (which is pretty funny in my opinion, considering they are cleaner indusries and Alcoa uses some pretty nasty process) Standard Oil has done what I said and Walmart tpyically resorts to methods that essentially stomp out all competition.   I will say, I don't typically venture into the evils of business. Your thoughts are always welcomed.    Large corporations I see are those who actively attempt to keep competition low. Capitalism I see is the notion of a free market, where it is easy for compeititon to arise, and a large number of competitiors exist in a certain market.   Well, see here's where I'm sure you understand the practical nature of all this. I got to say that corporations are generally needed in the economy, just for the reason that many industries/people depend on a highly productive/financed business. Many small business fall short of our current paradigm.   It's like Jefferson saying farming should be the primary nature of America, it just isn't that simple. But yeah, many corporations want to get rid of competition.     Such as? I haven't heard of any other business that artifically lowers it's prices, even to the point where it is taking a substantially loss, to get rid of all compeitition then raising prices drastically. Their ability to absorb losses better then mom and pop allows them to dumb products at abnornmally low prices.  Many corporate retail establishments.   Hell, my buddy sells furniture from China to contractors, and it's cheaper then chips. *overemphasis* This guy will out sell anyone around here, and it shows in pocketbook. He plans to run a bank in the next 20 years. I'm sure he will.  Although I will note that many of the advantages he holds is by virtue of the Chinese government...even though I might conceive them as vices.    Such as patenting "Window?"  You got it.    What forms of regulation do you support?  On business in general:  *Regulations on nucleur facilities/possible military weapons systems. Just to make sure they're not used for ill-purposes domestically.   *A general regulation that forbids any 'forced' labor on children. I believe they should be able to work, I just don't think they should be forced. I just don't think of children as slaves. I'm sure most of you will agree.  *All 'objective' harm to the enviroment e.g oil spills as theLibertarian was referring to.    *Absolutely no government subsidies in the private sector or laws favoring business enterprises. Ain't that a kicker for regulations. Is this one? hmmm  I can't think of many that I would support.
 I don't have a problem with the idea of a corporation, but many modern corporations have systems that are dubious in the realm of ethics. However, many are very clean, such as Costco. Heck they opened a gas station that was a 5-10 cents cheaper and none of the gas stations around have gone out of business, and that was a 18 months ago!  Yeah, I like Costco, but I never seem to go.    Now, walmart opened up a store in my state and within several months virtually every smaller store that competed with them went out of business because of their activities in a 5 mile radius.   The market dictates this. Yes, it's sad to see the little ones go; especially when the service there seems better at times...but it's the people that choice it. They could always chose to stay with the small shops.    The idea of a corporation is not inherently bad, it is their activites in terms of competition that warrant the evil/good labels. Yes, most small businesses fail, but that doesn't mean that small business is a bad idea. For at least half of America's history, the country was dominated by small business.  Both are nescessary, imo. One is more or less for high production, while the other is innovative, and new.     Life is never that simple, but it would be interesting to see most large corporations embrace true capitalism.   Paradigms do shift. Give technology a little more time, and you might see something special.    That is a truer capitalism then big business runs.   Ask that from the kids he enslaves. j/k, I don't know how he gets the product as cheap as he does. Trade secret.    ahhahaha. That's pretty funny.   It's true. China has set-up their economy in a way that over-favors their production to a point.    Thank someone for the rationality of the courts. It's bad enough that Trump wanted to patent "you're fired," and the hoax of Metallica wanting to patent the key "G," but c'mon what is wrong with this system?   It's just silly.       Hmmm. Forced as in? Family needs the money, so the kid has to work? Or completely voluntary?   As in the kid does it voluntarily. I don't think kids would have a problem working if the family needed money...if fact some did it to survive. But to put an obligation on a child with out their consent, is almost slavery in my perception.    How about for education? I don't have problems with government research funds to universities, private or public, considering that we need the research they are doing, even if it is run like a business. That's probably the only exception to the subsidaries I can think of.  Voluntary funds, not general. Education needs to be free of government, but I don't believe public school shouldn't exist if they're support by individuals. Then again, I don't think that's conceivable if not pooled into the general funds; because I do think private schools (given a bigger market) would find it in their interest to lower their admission fees, and offer a better education. They don't have that choice right now.
 I don't have a problem with the idea of a corporation, but many modern corporations have systems that are dubious in the realm of ethics. However, many are very clean, such as Costco.   Costco. I take the family to Costco at least twice a month. We do most of our shopping at Costco.  In cities throughout the US, Costco has gotten prime property via legislation. Let me explain that.   Eminent Domain is the Constitution, and is a method for the state to take land and use it for their purposes. I don&#8217;t mind that usually, but many times the cities will use this authority to take land (usually from the smaller business person) and give it to Costco.  Many cities have taken it a step further. Cities have enacted legislation that permits the creation of Redevelopment Agencies. These agencies typically take land (the pay fair market value or more of course) and sell it to a larger corporation. I have yet to see these agencies take land from a Large Corporation like Costco and give it to the small companies.   Eventually, via our do-good legislators, we will only have a few large corporations, I think. I would love to see this change.
That's not the case. The less laws, the more large combinations will combine reducing competition - and even if they don't combine in a real sense - such as a merger, they will collude to price fix.  I don&#8217;t think that mergers are the biggest culprit in the creation of mega-corporations. I would like to see more evidence. I have given several examples on how laws have helped the big guy over the small guy.    In this thread or others about capitalism there were some examples of how temporary monopolies can benefit the society. I stated a reason in post 11 that explains why collusion in price fixing does not work forever.    Unrestrained capitalism is a beast that will eat itself.  I disagree for the same reasons I have been giving all along. There may be some legislation that was passed that has kept corporations small (Anti-trust) but did it really benefit the society?
What is amazing, and incredibly saddening is that price is more important than anything else. Wal-mart has used Chinese prison slave labor, child sweat shops, sexist policies, and other very dubious acts, but people still choose them over more ethical competition because of price. Morals and ethics are chump change when it comes to low prices.   If it makes you feel better, I don't shop with them. Probably because I don't have one around, but I guess you can say I'm not much of a consumer...I don't believe it's the 'American way'.     That would be hard to prove though. A kid could simply lie to you out of fear.   Not if it goes directly to an authority. Signed--sealed--and delievered. It's much like abuse, it's really up to the slight courage of a child. Yes, fear can be a factor.     It's not. Education, from K-12 and higher is incredibly expensive. Most private schools and universities live on the donations of their alumni. My private highschool was short $2,000 after tuition. $60 million short every year.   Well, your thinking with a given market of a few. Public school is monopoly, and the price is way out of line according to the real demand. I'm quite sure that it would adjust accordingly...hell, if one could afford a computer, then one can afford an education via online.

People complain about the little toys in Wal-Mart being made by cheap labor while they drive their imported cars. What a bunch of hypocrites. Don&#8217;t they realize that their ONE car is about as valuable as the whole toy department (or close to it). Many of these same people have a Toyota and Honda in the garage and complain about jobs going overseas.  < Edited <  I think it is a good thing some of our products are made overseas. We don&#8217;t need to make our socks. I hope Americans are beyond that. We should be making the satellites, heart-lung machines, pacemakers, and other high-tech stuff. I think it is OK to buy socks made in Thailand or cars with parts made in Asia.   That is my opinion. Oh yah, I don&#8217;t think it is OK for anyone to be a slave, kids or adults. I do think kids should be allowed to work.

Don't they realize that their ONE car is about as valuable as the whole toy department (or close to it). Many of these same people have a Toyota and Honda in the garage and complain about jobs going overseas.   Just so you know, the majority of Japanese cars sold in the US are also assembled in the US and thus provide Americans with thousands of jobs at these plants.
Just so you know, the majority of Japanese cars sold in the US are also assembled in the US and thus provide Americans with thousands of jobs at these plants.  Many are and like us, the Japanese are always looking for cheap labor. ;) Labor rates in Japan have become astronomical. They are moving past the manufacturing stage in their development. They now realize (like we will hopefully someday), that it is better to market products than manufacture them.   I live near the port of Long Beach and see fields of cars brought in everyday. I actually have no problem with that. I do have a problem with people that complain about imports after one of their major purchases was an import car.   Thanks for pointing that out FF.
We have a German family car, I drive a Japanese p/u truck and have three much older American hobby trucks. I haven't purchased a US marque vehicle in many, many years, primarily due to low quality and poor resale value.  You are so right. In fact, it was the Japanese Imports that forced American Auto Makers to improve. We have. We would all still be driving 1960&#8217;s quality cars if we put massive tariffs on imports or a protectionist policy.   I buy for quality and find few American made products that measure up to imports, as US companies cut quality in attempts to make up the difference in labor/benefits/compliance in cost of goods. As an example, Chinese bearings are now the world standard. If you want a US made bearing, it has to be special ordered and costs double the imported product. I find that typical in most product lines. We now live in a world economy.   I think American Products are typically better than imports. The price is usually higher.   I wouldn't be quite so harsh on emerging industrial nations. Considering that it hasn't been all that long ago that we used children for manufacturing labor and women had no legal rights added to the fact that it was only 40-years when ago we segregated our public schools, it does sound a little righteous.   I think it my point was misconstrued. My point is made in the post right above this. I will edit the part about a poll. Thanks.
ps: The prisons in our state now compete with private industry in everything from body work to graphics and printing. Using prison labor paid pennies per hour.  I have heard unions complain about prison labor. Speaking of unions, I favor a repeal of the collective bargaining laws.
 Patents don't equat to monopolies. You can use your patent to gain money by selling your idea out.  Yes they do. If you get a patent on something, under the law, I can&#8217;t sell your idea unless you give me permission. It is the worse kind of monopoly; It is one created and enforced by law.   No, Standard Oil is the standard example of bad big business. They used price-fixing with the railways etc to put businesses to the wall. That is what rampant capitalism does - allows hard-working small business to be destroyed by companies using foul play.  That is the standard textbook answer, but it does not respond to my post. If you were to ask ronound economists of today like Nobel Prize winner Milton Freedman or Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan (from the book Capitalism) they would disagree with this standard textbook answer.   Here is some interesting information concerning anti-trust laws. Remember when IBM was sued under anti-trust laws. Their &#8220;monopoly&#8221; did not last forever. The same will happen with Microsoft. By the time a anti-trust suit is completed their market share will have fallen because of Linux.    http://www.capitalism.org/faq/antitrust.htm  Writes Dominick Armentano [professor of economics at the University of Hartford],  The little-known truth is that when the government took Standard Oil to court in 1907, Standard Oil's market share had been declining for a decade. Far from being a "monopoly," Standard's share of petroleum refining was approximately 64% at the time of trial. Moreover, there were at least 147 other domestic oil-refining competitors in the market &#8212; and some of these were large, vertically integrated firms such as Texaco, Gulf Oil, and Sun. Kerosene outputs had expanded enormously (contrary to usual monopolistic conduct); and prices for kerosene had fallen from more than $2 per gallon in the early 1860s to approximately six cents per gallon at the time of the trial. So much for the myth of the Standard Oil "monopoly."  &#8230;Don't the antitrust laws stop monopolistic practices?  Absolutely not. Harmful monopolies from the old AT&T monopoly (created by government regulations), to the U.S. Post Office monopoly were created by the state. The U.S. Post Office, for example, maintains its monopoly on the lucrative first class mail market by having the state outlaw its competition.  Take for example Judge Learned Hand's indictment of ALCOA. What 'crimes' was ALCOA punished for? To quote Hand:  "It was not inevitable that it should always anticipate increases in the demand for ingot and be prepared to supply them. Nothing compelled it to keep doubling and redoubling its capacity before others entered the field. It insists that it never excluded competitors; but we can think of no more effective exclusion than progressively to embrace each new opportunity as it opened, and to face every new- comer with new capacity already geared into a great organization, having the advantage of experience, trade connections and the elite of personnel." [Alan Greenspan, "Antitrust" published in Ayn Rand's Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]   In other words ALCOA was being punished for being too good a company, too competent in its management, in other words Alcoa's crime is that it is too competitive.     HERE IS ANOTHER GREAT ARTICLE:  http://www.nathanielbranden.net/ess/ton01.html  A reader asks:   In a society of laissez-faire capitalism, what would prevent the formation of powerful monopolies able to gain control over the entire economy?   Nathaniel Branden responds:   One of the worst fallacies in the field of economics &#8212; propagated by Karl Marx and accepted by almost everyone today, including many businessmen &#8212; is that the development of monopolies is an inescapable and intrinsic result of the operation of a free, unregulated economy. In fact, the exact opposite is true. It is a free market that makes monopolies impossible&#8230;.
If tou have title to land, that gives you exclusive rights to it. That is not a monopoly. Even if you've got the only house with a particularly stunning view, it's not a 'monopoly' that you own it. It's about property rights you own. Patents protect intellectual property. It is not a 'monopoly'. And thus, it's a very poor analogy.   Intellectual property is not real property IMHO. By owning a piece of property you do have a quasi-monopoly of its use. Others need your permission to use it.    Really. Have you got any quotes from them endorsing monopolies?   I admit I was surprised when I read the book Capitalism. He goes into depth in that book about Anti-trusts. Here is a quote from Greenspan:  http://www.rense.com/political/greenspanmono.htm  The government should not interfere with monopolies that maintain dominance through cost efficiencies and low prices, the Fed chief said in testimony to a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the current wave of corporate mergers.   "By the measure of what benefits consumers, such enterprises should not be discouraged," Greenspan said.    That's because their monopolies were broken by government. You should be applauding IBM and condeming the breaking up of their stranglehold. Your example disproves your point about government.   The suit against IBM was dropped after more than a decade in court. It became apparent IBM did not have a monopoly.    Standard Oil had already been subject to anti-trust laws prior to this. If it weren't for those laws they would have been in a position to continue their gain on markets.   Read that post again. Standard continued to lose market share even before the suit was settled.   I can't tell if you're for it or aginst it.   I am against the post offices monopoly on first class mail.    And would not being 'too competitive' lead to a monopoly? (if not for govenment action)   What do you suggest, to not be competitive? Monopolies do not last forever, unless created by government action.   How so? You can have laws that enable markets to be free of monopolies  It is easier for a large corporation to comply with regulations. For instance: if a company of three people must pay someone to withhold income tax - would they pay more or less per employee for compliance than a large company of 50,000 employees?   Various companies offer compliance services (ADP &#8211; Automatic Data Processing is one). They give a discount for companies (on a per capita basis) with more employees. If you are a really big company you will handle this compliance in house, cutting the per capita cost even more.  Because of compliance burdens, the smaller companies will fail.
All of your property should be protected. If you wrote an original work; screen-play, novel, musical piece, these too are protected - by copyright, which offers protections as patents do. Therefore the analogy between a patent and a monopoly has failed.   No. Your belief that intellectual property is real property has failed. The paper the screenplay was written on was real, but nobody can prove that what was written was original.  We have been contacted by patent attorneys before. The latest was by Black and Decker. They told us we violated their trademark by selling orange colored drills (like DeWalt). Amazon has patented the one click check out but they really didn&#8217;t invent it. They just made it to the patent office first.   Interesting reading. I particularly liked... "However, antitrust experts noted that, for example, aluminium giant Alcoa, was a monopoly for 50 years before antitrust action in the 1940s and Standard Oil held a 90 percent share of the market for 25 years before its break-up in 1911."   The first article spoke of refining and this one speaks of market share (maybe share of the final product, with some purchased from other refiners &#8211; maybe because Standards marketing was better for other refiners &#8211; they could get more money using Standard). Evidently, other companies refined petroleum. This does not prove a monopoly will last forever.   What would compel a monopoly to have low prices? I would suggest - regulation of prices. I believe Greenspan is against regulation that prevents a monopoly as long as the economic benefits to consumers are maintained - this could be done through laws. He doesn't say. And the key to this is found in this paragraph... "Federal Trade Commission Chairman Robert Pitofsky said Greenspan was advocating letting all mergers proceed and then wait and see if action was necessary. "I don't agree with that," Pitofsky said." Ibid. In other words he's not pro-monopoly in an absolute sense. He would prefer to let monopolies remain so long as they behaved in a way beneficial to consumers. There is not way to maintain this without regulation.   What would compel a monopoly to have lower prices? Competition. Like I said before, when a monopoly raises its price others jump in.   As per Greenspan, this is what he said:  The Sherman Act may be understandable when viewed as a projection of the nineteenth century's fear and economic ignorance. But it is utter nonsense in the context of today's economic knowledge. The seventy additional years of observing industrial development should have taught us something. If the attempts to justify our antitrust statutes on historical grounds are erroneous and rest on a misinterpretation of history, the attempts to justify them on theoretical grounds come from a still more fundamental misconception.   Okay, if they didn't have a monopoly, then they are irrelevant as an example to this debate.   Actually they did have a monopoly. The point is that monopolies don&#8217;t last forever.   I thought you were pro-monopoly   LOL, no. I am against Anti-trust laws.    Some monopolies would exist naturally, I realise. Such might be with regards a water-sewerage board. Unless you can imagine having competing sets of toilets in peoples homes and you choose the one providing the better service :) However in this country, they are run by the government and prices are controlled.  Monopolies for an extended time are not natural. The monopolies you describe are created by the government. As per your example of the toilet, I agree. On the other had I would allow multiple cable TV companies to compete.
Hang on. I never said intellectual property was real property. If we're dealing with legal definitions then real property doesn't refer to things that are 'really' property, but property that is 'real' in the sense that it is material, and in general refers to land, buildings etc. as opposed to property that is an 'idea', which is intellectual property.  Property Any thing that is possessed or owned. http://www.legal-dictionary.org/ld.asp?q=property This includes... real property n. 1) all land, structures, firmly attached and integrated equipment (such as light fixtures or a well pump), anything growing on the land, and all "interests" in the property, which may include the right to future ownership (remainder), right to occupy for a period of time (tenancy or life estate), the right to drill for oil, the right to get the property back (a reversion) if it is no longer used for its current purpose (such as use for a hospital, school or city hall), use of airspace (condominium) or an easement across another's property. Real property should be thought of as a group of rights like a bundle of sticks which can be divided. It is distinguished from personal property which is made up of movable items. 2) one of the principal areas of law like contracts, negligence, probate, family law and criminal law. See also: condominium easement life estate personal property real estate reversion http://dictionary.law.com/definition2.asp?selected=1727&bold=|||| You said a patent is like a monopoly. That is the analogy you made. A patent is to protect intellectual property. I said that other forms of property are protected and gave examples of real and other intellectual property. You had no problem with that. THEREFORE you analogy has failed. As to proving if something is original - it can be done to the satisfaction of the courts - there is a whole line of law on intellectual property. Your assertion that it can't be done is wrong. You can do this at http://www.mediaregister.com/examples/   First off, I didn&#8217;t say a patent is like a monopoly, I said it creates a monopoly. Therefore my analogy did not fail. You brought up real property in one of your posts and I agree it is not real property.   Your analogy failed because the ownership of a property DOES give the owner a monopoly for the use of THAT property. No one else can build on it or even walk on it without the owner&#8217;s permission.    And this is relevant, why? Are you now saying that you don't support the protection of intellectual property? If I own a product and I produce it with a distinctive shape, colour and name, and I build up trust for that product, and you come along and market your product under very similar packaging, name etc, then you are trading off my property... in this case the trust that I have earn.  If there is a such thing, why does the protection stop after a time? This &#8220;intellectual property&#8221; is not the same as property, real or otherwise.   And this is relevant, why? Are you now saying that you don't support the protection of intellectual property? If I own a product and I produce it with a distinctive shape, colour and name, and I build up trust for that product, and you come along and market your product under very similar packaging, name etc, then you are trading off my property... in this case the trust that I have earn. Here is a suit made over 'decor' In 1987, Taco Cabana, a chain of Mexican restaurants in Houston, Texas, brought suit against Two Pesos, a rival chain, claiming that Two Pesos had deliberately copied Taco Cabana's décor.  http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property99/history.html For someone who doesn't like government I see that you would also reject protection for property too.   Are you an attorney? Attorneys just love this stuff. I can see these two taco companies in court suing the other. The one with the most money will likely win.  I do respect property, I just don&#8217;t define it as you do. I don&#8217;t consider words on a paper or a color as being property.    As to proving if something is original - it can be done to the satisfaction of the courts - there is a whole line of law on intellectual property. Your assertion that it can't be done is wrong. You can do this at http://www.mediaregister.com/examples/   Again, attorneys just love it.   It is your assertion that a monopoly will not last forever, except with government control. It is your assertion that Standard Oil was not a monopoly, and with 90% of the market, I fail to see then what you would in fact call a monopoly.   I would call the Postal First Class Mail a monopoly. Standard Oil had a monopoly, but again I say, it would not last forever. In fact, if Standard would have been allowed to continue and raise the price of gas, we may be using alternative forms of fuel today. In other words, I believe that Standard Oil may still be around today, but they would not have a monopoly on energy.   Your kidding! How can you have a monopoly, and real competition?   Let me say it one more time: If a company raises it&#8217;s price other competitors will compete. I stated this in a post prior to this.   What stopped it lasting?   Dell Computer and Microsoft.    Really, so you'd welcome laws against monopolies in other forms, other than anti-trust laws?   I didn&#8217;t say that. Just because I don&#8217;t like something does not mean I think it should be outlawed. Besides, monopolies don&#8217;t last forever and sometimes they can benefit society (see my other posts). Monopolies are part of the natural capitalist cycle that benefits everyone. I know the last statement is shocking, and I would not have said this 15 years ago.    It is easier to lay down new cables, than sewerage and water pipes... at least at present levels of technology. I can't imagine that the bathrooms of the future would have multiple taps from different companies. Or, you change your contract from Fox Sewerage to Bell, and someone comes out and installs a new toilet, with a pay-by-use application.   LOL, that was a good one. Hey, we agree on something here. Note: These are local city or county regulations unlike national patent or copyright laws.  Monte, it has been fun. I feel like I am beginning to repeat myself.
Saying something is alike something else is to make it an analogy. You said that a patent (a form of protection over property) creates a monopoly. I stated that other forms of property protection would also therefore be 'monopolies' as with an example from real property where-by regardless of how much I might like the view from your land I can't use it without your permission. Hence an extension of your analogy - equating patents with monopolies, shows the flaw in your logic. It remains your analogy. I simply extended it to show other forms of property - including other forms of intellectual property - such as a screen-play. And you disputed that a screen-play could be shown to be original. This interpretation would have fundamental consequences (were it to be adapted) to property law.   Here is where you are wrong: I don&#8217;t believe patents should be protected because I don&#8217;t consider ideas property. This nullifies the rest of the first paragraph.   If you are against monopolies, then why should some one be able to monopolize their property? Shouldn&#8217;t anyone be able to build on it? This does not seem consistent.  Here is where I am consistent: I believe the government should protect our property rights, but I don&#8217;t consider words on paper property.   Your argument is all over the place. You asked why can't monopolies exist because patents are alike monopolies. You said 'patents create monopolies. It is not about creating a 'monopoly' it is about protecting property.   That is your opinion. Why is it not protected like property forever?   They are different things. If I own something, I have exclusive rights to it. That is not a monopoly. A monopoly is where we are in competition and you drive me and competitors out of business.   Just because someone drives someone out of business does not make that person a monopoly. Even if a person were to drive EVERYONE out of that business, does not mean the monopoly will be permanent.    You question whether intellectual property exists? It is really property. It is a field of law. Studied at Berkley http://www.law.berkeley.edu/institutes/bclt/courses/fall02/ipintro.html and at Columbus http://faculty.cua.edu/fischer/Intro%20To%20IP%202003/IP%20Home.htm In part regulated by Copyright http://www.copyright.gov/ legislated around the world http://www.worldlii.org/catalog/2296.html It is most strange that you don't 'believe' that it exists.   I agree that is what the law says. The whole point to this discussion is that I don&#8217;t believe the law should say this.   I work with legal practitioners. I studied law very briefly in a formal sense(I have a habit of this - not completing studies; having attended at least six different universities), and for much longer in an informal sense (I have lots of time on my hands). However, it would suggest that if solicitors, barristers and other legal practitioners are all dealing with it, and you don't think it exists, this would seem that one of you is wrong.   The people that may be wrong are the ones with a vested interest in it.   I have taken some Business Law Classes. I have also taken some RE Law classes.   I don't define property. I give you definitions found in law. You define things not according to law, but your sense of injustice towards money-grubbing legal workers.  Again, it is the law I question.   Regardless, your assertion that it can't be defined as being original is wrong. It is fortunate too, because if not for this many hard working artists; screen-writers, musicians etc would have their efforts come to nothing, because people who don't believe their work is original would feel free to take it for themselves. It is one thing to argue that what they are doing is self-serving, money grubbing etc, and a totally different argument that the rights of intellectual property don't exist.   Monty, that is the best argument for patents, copyrights and trademarks. I was wondering when you would bring that up. Let me ask you a question: Recently pharmaceutical companies have been wanting to extend the length of a patent from 17 to 20 years. They claim that it would bring down the price of drugs. What do you think? I would rather see a five year patent that raising it to 20 or 50 years.   How do you prove this? It's not like saying "If not for settlers, the Dodo would still be around".   This is what can be proved: Some hundred years or so after the breakup of Standard Oil, we are still driving to the supermarket using petroleum products. It would be likely that if gas prices were higher, alternative forms of energy would be used.   I'm not sure that Microsoft is a competitor of IBM.   IBM basically had sales people that helped train employees how to use their equipment. It was quite an operation. With Windows you could train a monkey to use a computer.    I agree that monopolies are a product of unrestrained capitalism, which is why I'm not in favour of unrestrained capitalism. It is a system that defeats itself, by destroying competition.   You missed my point: Sometimes innovation can ONLY occur only if prices are increased because of a monopoly. If you try to keep prices permanently down with laws and regulation, we may not see the INOVATION. Why innovate?   I have retained my left-leaning feelings (at least as far as economics go)   I am far to the left with regards to personal freedom. We have something in common.   The only difference is which tier of government these laws live in. They are still guided by laws and regulations.   I prefer the local level.   I think though that your proposition that monopolies, if left to themselves will cease to remain long in being is untested.   We will never know because they are broken apart. That is why I brought the IBM example up: Before the suit was settled it became apparent they did not have a monopoly. The suit was just dropped.    There's a very good link site for intellectual property at... http://www.iaswww.com/ODP/Society/Law/Legal_Information/Intellectual_Property  Thanks for the discussion Monty. I am afraid this could go on forever. If you want to cut the discussion shorter just answer this one question: If copyrights ect are property, then why shouldn&#8217;t people be allowed to keep them forever, or do you advocate that?  Also, thanks for keeping the discussion civil. It is a plessure.
I am not wrong. Just because you offer an opinion that ideas aren't property doesn't negate the consensus of law-making bodies the world over that such things are property, and therefore should be protected. It is odd way to say 'no it isn't' and insist then that that rebuttal has destroyed my argument. I cited many a law sites that deal with it. If you want to actually offer why you feel it should not be protected, please do so. You've had several days to offer this, but the best offered is your repeating of a previously stated opinion.   Just because there is a law, does not mean I support it.   You ask why I don&#8217;t think there should not be patent laws: This law has the effect raising the cost of goods.    These are two different statements. If someone drove every competitor out of business, and their own business continued, that is a monopoly, because it is so defined. That a monopoly, un-hampered by government regulations (including regulations towards would-be competitors) would or would not last forever is the heart of your argument. You assume that it wouldn't based on an as yet ill-defined reason. It's not been tested - as far as I know. You've certainly offered no evidence of known cases.    Why drop Anti-trust cases then (Like IBM)?   Yes, the people who's rights are protected have a vested interest. You have a vested interest in your own property being protected.   That right is only as good as the money you have to protect it.   Sure, but IBM use Microsoft. They aren't in competition.   I didn&#8217;t say MS was a competitor.    In Australia we are more a centralised government. For instance police aren't at local level, but state and federal. I believe you have local school boards, we don't. In fact, all local governments could be swept out of existence at the whim of a state government. State governments can change local council borders, suspend councils etc. The only reason that they don't do so all the time is because people like their councils (in general) and would tend to punish such a government at the electoral box.   I think in general the concentration of power is a bad thing - even for a short while (perhaps in times of war, it might be necessary), and economic power is no exception.   That is why I like power given to local authorities. One sweeping law for the whole state or country is not always best.   You've caught me on the hop! I believe in property protection, but I've not ever thought about how long it should be protected for - it's something I've never thought about. That's what I'll do. If I remember, I'll ask some people at work. A lady I worked with has actually specialised in intellectual property, but she's not responded to my e-mails for some months. I guess I'll see what happens.  Most people wouldn't think so, but it is what I aim to do - exchange ideas. I tend though to fight fire with fire, and you've not been insulting. Your post has now prompted me into thinking about something I've never really considered.  You are an incredibly nice person. I do have an analogy for the length of property rights. I guess you could consider it a lease. People lease a right to a patent etc.  Let me explain my position of patents etc.:  Right now many people in the US are complaining about the high cost of prescription drugs. The drug companies have a patent on their products, and can charge whatever they want. Of course, the best argument for patents is the reason you gave: Why research new drugs if someone can just copy it?   I contend these researchers would continue to work, but make less money (I doubt they would all become greeters at Wal-Mart). They would have to change the way they distribute drugs. The same goes for movies. The movie stars would be paid far less and distribution may change.  Going back to pharmaceutical drugs: In the US many advocate the government picking up the cost of the drugs. That is the last thing I want to see happen. Others advocate price controls. If you advocate price controls, why even offer a patent on the product?   What is happening here? IMHO, we tinkered with the free market by allowing patents. Now we blame the free market for the high cost of goods.   IMHO, all laws hurt poor people. The patent laws drive up the price of goods, because those with the patent can charge what they want. The free market is not functioning.  We discussed two items here Monty: One was Anti-Trust Laws, and the other was Patent Laws. Can you tell I don&#8217;t favor many laws?
http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/95psa.html  I thought this essay was fairly interesting.   *But there are quite a few cases in which patents have been used to suppress innovation (Dunford 1987). Companies may take out a patent, or buy someone else's patent, in order to inhibit others from applying the ideas. For example, from its beginning in 1875, the US company AT&T collected patents in order to ensure its monopoly on telephones. It slowed down the introduction of radio for some 20 years. In a similar fashion, General Electric used control of patents to retard the introduction of fluorescent lights, which were a threat to its market of incandescent lights.  *One of the newest areas to be classified as intellectual property is biological information. US courts have ruled that genetic sequences can be patented, even when the sequences are found "in nature," so long as some artificial means are involved in isolating them. This has led companies to race to take out patents on numerous genetic codes. In some cases, patents have been granted covering all transgenic forms of an entire species, such as soybeans or cotton (Mestel 1994). One consequence is a severe inhibition on research by non-patent holders. Another consequence is that transnational corporations are patenting genetic materials found in Third World plants and animals, so that some Third World peoples actually have to pay to use seeds and other genetic materials that have been freely available to them for centuries (Shiva and Holla-Bhar 1993).  *The potential financial returns from intellectual property are said to provide an incentive for individuals to create. In practice, though, most creators do not actually gain much benefit from intellectual property. Independent inventors are frequently ignored or exploited (Lancaster 1992). When employees of corporations and governments have an idea worth protecting, it is usually copyrighted or patented by the organisation, not the employee. Since intellectual property can be sold, it is usually the rich and powerful who benefit. The rich and powerful, it should be noted, seldom contribute much intellectual labour to the creation of new ideas. Note: Look at Telsa, and Edison...you'll understand.  *A second major argument for intellectual property is that people deserve property rights because of their labour. This brings up the general issue of what people deserve, a topic that has been analysed by philosophers. Their usual conclusions go against what many people think is "common sense." Hettinger says that a fitting reward for labour should be proportionate to the person's effort, the risk taken and moral considerations. This sounds all right--but it is not proportionate to the value of the results of the labour, whether assessed through markets or by other criteria. This is because the value of intellectual work is affected by things not controlled by the worker, including luck and natural talent. Hettinger says "A person who is born with extraordinary natural talents, or who is extremely lucky, deserves nothing on the basis of these characteristics" (p. 42).  *Another example is scientific knowledge. Scientists do research and then publish their results. A large fraction of scientific knowledge is public knowledge (Ziman 1968). There are some areas of science that are not public, such as classified military research. It is generally argued that the most dynamic parts of science are those with the least secrecy. Open ideas can be examined, challenged, modified and improved. To turn scientific knowledge into a commodity on the market, as is happening with genetic engineering (Mackenzie et al. 1990; Weiner 1986), arguably inhibits science.   *The case of science shows that vigorous intellectual activity is quite possible without intellectual property, and in fact that it may be vigorous precisely because information is not owned. But there are lots of areas that, unlike science, have long operated with intellectual property as a fact of life. What would happen without ownership of information? Many objections spring to mind. Here I'll deal with a few of them.  Plagiarism is a great fear in the minds of many intellectual workers. It is often thought that intellectual property provides a protection against plagiarism. After all, without copyright, why couldn't someone put their name on your essay and publish it? Actually, copyright provides very little protection against plagiarism and is not a good way to deal with it (Stearns 1992).  Plagiarism means using the ideas of others without adequate acknowledgement. There are several types of plagiarism. One is plagiarism of ideas: someone takes your original idea and, using different expression, presents it as their own. Copyright provides no protection at all against this form of plagiarism. Another type of plagiarism is word-for-word plagiarism, where someone takes the words you've written--a book, an essay, a few paragraphs or even just a sentence--and, with or without minor modifications, presents them as their own. This sort of plagiarism is covered by copyright--assuming that you hold the copyright. In many cases, copyright is held by the publisher, not the author. In practice, plagiarism goes on all the time, in various ways and degrees (Broad and Wade 1982; Mallon 1989; Posner 1988), and copyright law is hardly ever used against it. The most effective challenge to plagiarism is not legal action but publicity. At least among authors, plagiarism is widely condemned. To be exposed as a plagiarist is more than sufficient motivation for most writers to take care to avoid it.  *What about all the writers, inventors and others who depend for their livelihood on royalties? First, it should be mentioned that only a very few individuals make enough money from royalties to live on. Most of the rewards from intellectual property go to a few big companies. But the question is still a serious one for those intellectual workers who depend on royalties and other payments related to intellectual property.  The alternative in this case is some reorganisation of the economic system. Intellectual workers could receive a salary, just like most scientists do.  But what about the incentive to create? Without the possibility of wealth and fame, what would stimulate creative individuals to produce works of genius? Actually, most creators and innovators are motivated by their own intrinsic interest, not by rewards. There is a large body of evidence showing, contrary to popular opinion, that rewards actually reduce the quality of work (Kohn 1993). If the goal is better and more creative work, paying creators on a piecework basis, such as through royalties, is counterproductive.
 Obviously he's concerned about protecting what he's written; protecting his intellectual property. You need to seek his permission to use his intellectual property; even when he's arguing against intellectual property.    Not nescessarily.   Whether or not the publication company has rights to his writing, is perhaps in question. Many companies require that they acquire some/most rights to a writer efforts, as I'm assuming in those cases.   Regardless, the ideas aren't invalid in face of any actions committed by it's author (even though I would assume there are none). So in the effort to retain some focus, let's stay to the point, and not fixate on it's creator.  Are his points invalid, that is the question?   Generally speaking, I think intellectual rights are taken to an extreme. Given they were limited to a short-term of time, I wouldn't have many or any objections. That isn't the case, and it's undenialable that certain technologies/inventions have been swept under the rug because of it.
Monty, I do think that Real Property and Personal Property should be protected.  But: Intellectual Property is usually protected by civil lawsuits. For instance the RIAA is going after Pirates civilly. Some trademarks are protected using government force, but most are in investigated at first privately.   Can you imagine the government bureaucracy that would be required to go after every music pirate criminally, investigators, prosecutors and such?   This is why I say that patents, trademarks and copyrights are only as good as the money you have to protect them.
Rick, that article you posted in post #43 is in line with my point. Thanks.  The ATT example was interesting also.
 I do not believe in copyrights, and I can understand peoples sentiments against them. I do not perceive them to be an individual right.  HUH? Copywrites and patents are pretty much the same thing, a protection of intellectual property.   I would hate it if I invented something that everyone could use, put my time and money into it, only to have everyone copy it, and I would never see a dime.

PNAC, that is the best argument IMHO in favor of these "protections".

Even libertarians must keep in mind the existence of natural monopolies, that is, monopolies such as power plants, roads, etc. that can not be efficient and competitive at the same time. I personally believe that these monopolies should be state-owned, and these should be the only state-owned businesses, and the private sector should encompass all that is competitive.  I don't consider them natural, and I don't want them owned by the state. BUT, I don't want multiple power lines run all around the county for seperate carriers. I will accept a few monopolies (utilities). That is my opinion.
As a red blooded american (didn't the soviets call themselves red-blooded too right?) I despise communism in all forms (except chinese communism which supplies us with cheap goods) but since i am creating some abrasion in socialist britain where i currently live i wish to learn more about the principals of marxism so i can understand what i hate. thanx
Yes i know that China and russia were never communist but they were covered as that under a blanket statement Lenin adapted his ideas from communism and Mao adapted his ideas from the U.S.S.R and to you eddie i wanted to know anybodys opinions and their reasons for their opinion
Read Marx's writings yourself. That'll give you a much better idea of it than any of us ever could.  Duo Maxwell- What you seem to be saying is that Communism works well in theory, on paper. The problem is the world doesn't exist on paper. It is not simply  a problem with the way it was "interpreted," it is inherent problems with the idea itself.  Harlequin- read it and you will probably understand what I mean.
Communism and Maoism were bastardization's of Marxism.  Anybody else realise the PNAC's ideals are from Marx and Trotsky's writings?
I would suggest that you might first understand what your own position is, your own philosophy. You may find you don't actually agree with the things that on the surface, you seem to support, or reject. "Hating" sounds emotional, and this is a philosophical topic really, not an emotional one.  Second, Marx was essentially a philosopher with interesting ideas, that were founded on what I think are flawed premises. Namely that people are not inherently selfish. Yes, his idea was to improve the lives of everyone, through the rejection of selfishness (capitalism). What an evil person right? I mean, bettering life for everyone? What a horrible goal!! Capitalistic governments, didn't really like this and waged war on such governments. Why? Because they were rich and powerful and did not...ahem, want to see their way of life changed (among other reasons, some much more praise-worthy, that's biased for contrast).   Ultimately it may come down to two differences in philosophy:  1. Do you think people are naturally selfish? 2. Do you think people are naturally altrustic?  Would a system designed contrary to what you think is "natural" have a chance of succeeding in the long term?  I think #1, and no. And that's why capitalism seems to work well. Will it crash and burn in 100 years? Don't know, but it's done OK so far. And frankly, if you asked me overall am I happy with my life in a primarily capitalistic democracy, the answer is, yes.  -Mach
I don't think so. Communism will work: just not with humans. Communism would require a species that is inherently alturistic, which obviously excludes us. The closes thing we got to Commnusim is alturistic societies in the Andes, and even then it doesn't work that well. But the point is communism would require a completely different mindset.  Pardon what may come across as rude but-- whoop-dee-doo. It doesn't really matter if it could work with non-humans does it? The point is WE ARE human and as humans, it doesn't work with us. Here's the essential difference between capitalism and communism: *Capitalism takes advantage of human self-interest and succeeds because of it. *Communism ignores human self-interest and fails because of it.
We do have instances of alutristic communism in some tribes in the Andes which have suvirved for thousands of years. they are technologically backwards, but that is expected with Communsim. However, on the whole it won't work with humans, but that does not mean the system is absolutely flawed.  I don't know anything about this, but I'll take your word for it. The important thing to remember in this case is that this kind of thing can work fine on a small, community level, but it is a completely different animal when applied to the large governmental level. Look at American communes. They work very differently, not just better, but very differently. But even on this level plently of people try to take advantage of it. Just ask a hippie or someone in the Rainbow Family. On top of everything else, this kind of thing isn't wholly Marxism either.  Again, the problems that communist governments face and have faced in the past, are not simply due just to human failing. There are inherent flaws in Marxism--the labor theory of value, no real motivation for advancement of any kind (technologically, economically, etc.). It was a nice dream, and it has given us very interesting ways of looking at the world, but on a practical level, it is only  a dream.  Yes it does matter. Many opponents declare that Communism is a failed system that can never work. I disagree, it can work, it just requires a foregin, if not alien mindset Communism would require a species that is inherently alturistic, which obviously excludes us.  Well that's nice. Maybe beings on another planet have obtained copies of Marx's writings and are living peacefully in this system (that's if they fixed the flaws, but if they did it woudn't really be communism). Maybe one day they'll come abduct us all and probe us and give us the ability to live like this too. Until then we are who we are, it is what it is, and it hasn't and won't work with us.
True, it's not, but it is far closer then what the USSR or China got to.  Marxism as a pure idea doesn't have flaws. When it is applied to humans, then it is us who have the flaws. That doesn't make us inherently bad, but merely that the idea cannot be practically applied to us.  You obviously didn't see my two examples. These are only two among many. Have you read Marx? It doesn't sound like it. It sounds like you have heard Marx through someone elses perspective and just taken that on. But if you have and you thought it was flawless and perfect than you are looking at it through extremely rose-colored glasses. You are not being realistic. You also have apparently ignored the rest of my post.
One could make the argument that Marxism as a theory lacks apparant flaws in its internal logic and therfor is theoreticly flawless. And that the problem arise when trying to explain, apply or compare reality with the marxist theory as it doesn`t describe the reality accuratly. This is more or less true for any economic, political, sociological, historic or philosophical theory.  Pardon me, but so what if it lacks flaws in its internal logic (which I don't know if it necessarily does, but let's say it does). You say that the problem arises when trying to apply it to reality. Well, what does any "economic, political, sociological, historic, or philosophical theory" matter if one can't apply it to relaity. That is their purpose. If you can't apply them, then they are useless. They aren't meant to be little entities unto themselves. What matters is that it was meant to, and has been, applied to governmental systems-"reality"-and it doesn't work. And, because I apparently need to state this in every post, it isn't just because humans are flawed, it is because the theory is flawed.
A theory should at least be expected to have a consistent internal logic. Otherwise, the theory is in bug trouble. Yes, yes I know, I was merely trying to say that it is useless if it only  has internal logic.  They matter because they may be applicable to a certain extent and they may explain certain phenomenons. I can`t think of a single large theory that describes social phenomenons completly accurate in every situation. But marxist theory can still be applied to certain situations and "succesfully" explain situations or phenomenons. You just can`t build a system of it (and once again I can`t think off a single theory or ideology that could be used to construct a perfect society) I never said it can't be applied to any situation or phenomenon. If you go back and read one of my posts, you will see I have already conceded that. I never said it should apply to all situations either. I have only been discussing its use as a governmental system.  Not really. There are many other uses of marxist theory than to simply create a society with the communist manifesto as a blue-print. It wasn't merely the Communist Manifesto that was important. In fact, it's probably the shortest thing Marx ever wrote. The problem is, most people have heard only  of the Communist Manifesto. So, people haven't used just this  writing in attempting to create new societies. This may sound like a tedious point, but I just wanted those who may not know about these things to know.  Ah, yes, once again I agree. It is flawed for that particular purpose of creating a society based on its assumptions and conclussions. But this is important to discuss because (despite its other aforementioned uses) this was its original sole  purpose. Its other uses have been added as time goes by. So, if we are discussing its use in creating a society/government, this is the purpose we should be discussing.
One could make the argument that Marxism as a theory lacks apparant flaws in its internal logic and therfor is theoreticly flawless. And that the problem arise when trying to explain, apply or compare reality with the marxist theory as it doesn`t describe the reality accuratly. This is more or less true for any economic, political, sociological, historic or philosophical theory.  Marxism has a logic flaw, though. It assumes that the proletarians - a group of people - behaves like a sovereign individual.   This is something that can work in reality: < Joe becomes dictator of the world and kills everbody else. < There is no one left to use force against Joe, so the state becomes useless and disappears. We have an anarchist utopia now because no one uses force anymore.  This is Marxism in bullets: < Proletarians hijack the state and use it to destroy the bourgeoisie < With the bourgeoisie gone, there is no one to oppress the proletarians, so the state becomes useless and disappears. We have an anarchist utopia now because no one uses force anymore.  The problem with Marxism is that it fails to recognize that proletarians can oppress other proletarians. Collective groups do not function unanimously, especially a group so large as the proletarians. A proletarian can use force against another proletarian.
Why do you think Marx believed that the state would wither and die? Because the existance of the state creates yet another master class, the political class. This class would naturally oppress the proletariate which in turn would lead to classwarfare which would end with the emancipation of the proletariate.   What I understand about Marxism is that when the proletarians establish their dictatorship, they will abolish their own superiority as a class and thus the state will disappear.
Michael Gorbachev said that the only model of true Communism exists in the State of Israel. The United States has supported Israel since its inception in 1947. This means that since 1947 the United States has supported what Gorbachev said was true Communism. After 58 years of support for a Communist Nation, Israel, it would seem reasonable to say that it is U. S. Government Policy to support Communism.   Without further information about Gorbachev's assertion (including what he meant by "true communism"), it's not sensible to argue that particular point.  Since your conclusion is not supported by any other evidence that you've chosen to cite, it is not reasonable to assent to it.
Communism will save the world from capitalist/fascist people who divide it with capital, communism unites everything to work for a common goal, and destroy private property the chains of labor. The sun of capitalism is setting. The sun of socialism is rising! Workers of the world unite!  Judging by the address you say you are writing from, can we assume that your observations are an ironic spoof ?
So what if I am a communist, communists are arrested, on the charge of helping the world  I don't think that being a communist is kind of moral blemish that is supposed to be shameful. Its just (which has been pointed out already) that Marxist social and economic policies are based on destructive fallacies. Support for these fallacies is probably a matter of emotional attachment rather than the result of impartial analysis.
Communism and Maoism were bastardization's of Marxism.  Anybody else realise the PNAC's ideals are from Marx and Trotsky's writings? Eh, it's sort of a capitalist Trotskyism. Sort of a permanent "capitalist" revolution. But, yeah, just substitute "proletariat" with "capitalist" and you've got it.
Communism will save the world from capitalist/fascist people who divide it with capital, communism unites everything to work for a common goal, and destroy private property the chains of labor. The sun of capitalism is setting. The sun of socialism is rising! Workers of the world unite!  Oh, please. Communists can criticize capitalism, but they cannot prove that their system is any better. It is absurd to connect totalitarian collectivism with the emancipation of the worker. What would really emancipate the worker would be to end the overextension of property rights into the realm of things that are not the fruits of labor. What is left when that happens is that the workers individually own the fruit of their labor - their true emancipation, not the collectivist hoax.
Neither. Capitalist economy, democratic socially (government).
Neither. Capitalist economy, democratic socially (government).  wow, thats hardcore...democratic society would be harsh. Having everyone vote is hard..that is why I like a republic :)
wow, thats hardcore...democratic society would be harsh. Having everyone vote is hard..that is why I like a republic :) OK, OK, I got loose w/the terminology. Democratic republic, with term limits for all government positions (even the positions Clinton liked best :) ).
I want to see thoughts on this. I would have to go with a democratic-republic just because we have rights and have the right to vote. Other than that, the idea of Communism is much more well rounded  Please explain what you mean by communism and democratic-rupublics.
Communism meaning the government russia had from the 1940s to 1990. Democratic- republic: the government the US has today.  Well, in that case I would go for the US government any day. Soviet russia was so far removed from the communist ideals of equality as contemporary Russia. Power, wealth and influence was concentrated in a precious elite... In fact, it`s probably the same elite that rules Russia today. I can`t think of any Soviet benefits over US-style democracy, apart from the societ educational system (but that`s not even entirely a political issue).
One more thing I'll post is thje rudimetary concept of communism: Everyone is equal. A farmer makes $40 a month than a doctor makes $20 a month. No one in a communist government owns land, so there are no rights, except for the members of the the communist party, they own land. Finally, there isn't an equalized system of healthcare, one person can afford healthcare, one cannot.  Errr... what? are you refering to the practice of Soviet-russia? I don`t think this has anything to do with the concept of communism. Not even with the concept of communism in Soviet-russia.
What you are describing is not communism in either fo your descriptions. The soviet unon was not a communist state by even the loosest definition. It was a totalitarian socialist state.  Communisim is a purely theoretical concept. It has never been tried. Under cummunism, everybody just kind of does the job they like and gets whatever they need to get by. In theory, very appealing. Every time it has been tried, it has resulted in a bunch of poor people, a bloodbath, and a ton of corrution.  Since communism is pretty much a failed system of ideals, I owudl go with a democratic republic, but NOT like we have in the US. What we have int he us is a severely flawed system that needs some correction.
The Soviet Union was a democracy. A one party state but they had a parliment and the people voted for the parliment. What people get confused about is that because they had one party the party controlled everything.  If you run an election with only one party, you are not really running an election, especially when the leaders of that party are choosing your canidate. We in America should keepthis in mind as we watch our 2 parties comingle to the point that they become indistinguishable.
communism works perfect in theory. In theory.  The problem is that it's so open to corruption, any communist government will quickly become authoritarian, totalitarian, etc.
Actually it doesn't work in theory either, except in communist theory, which is full of holes. Even were a communist society on the scale of a modern nation organised by angels, or altruistic robots, unable to be corrupted, it would still fail.
communism works perfect in theory. In theory.  The problem is that it's so open to corruption, any communist government will quickly become authoritarian, totalitarian, etc.  Fraudulent utopias - of which the USSR was one - result from the fantasies of intellectuals who believe that a "better society" can be created by the force of ideas.
From a letter in today's Wall Street Journal:  Hindus in U.S. Exemplify Capitalism's Basic Virtue Francis Fukuyama's formulation of the fundamental criteria of citizenship in European nations -- "blood, soil and ancient shared memory" -- captures perfectly the fatal flaw at the heart of European multiculturalism, and reveals the hypocrisy of the European contempt for the American experience ("A Year of Living Dangerously," editorial page, Nov. 2). Critically, what is missing from that formulation, and from Prof. Fukuyama's prescription for cure, is the role of capitalism, and the worship of the almighty dollar.  As Hayek and his disciples have pointed out, capitalism is the most democratic and virtuous of social systems: dollars are not black, white or red. And a society that accords social and cultural respect to those who succeed in the economic sphere is, by definition, more inclusive than one based on any other set of criteria.  Let's take a really (one would think) remote cultural group in America: Hindus. Something like 40% of hotel/motel properties in America are owned by Patels and their cousins. And they contribute to American society at every level: philanthropic, cultural and social -- because of the respect they are accorded for their economic success. One generation: from immigrant to university donor and honoree.  But societies that place economic success well below "blood, soil and ancient shared memory" in their pantheon of virtues are fated to spend eternity trying to square the circle: integrating those who do not share in those historical criteria, and never will.  Barry Augenbraun -- St. Petersburg, Fla.Actually, one could also cite the success of Chinese merchants all over the world, South Korean capitalists in the U.S. and quite a number of other non-Europeans around the world.  Do all of these groups hold values in common? Or, is there a distinct brand of Hindu capitalism as opposed to Chinese capitalism as opposed to South Korean capitalism? And, I'd better not slight the Japanese in this discussion.  I'm not sure I approve of Hayek's take on capitalism, though.
Let's not forget the astonishing success of the Haitian diaspora in this country, either.   I took Hayek's point to be that in a capitalistic society, any individual's race, creed, color, religion, parentage or ethnic background are irrelevant to success. The only relevant characteristics are the individual's competence and willingness to work.
Could I, at least, observe that Freedom Fighter is certainly diligent in his ongoing fight against freedom?
In a socialist nation, the government issues identity cards to all its citizens, to ensure "national security". Anyone suspected of wrongdoing can more easily be rounded up and imprisoned than in a free society.  In a socialist nation, the government is the most important entity in determining whether an individual or group of individuals is prosperous or not, if a business is suspected of having links to terrorism, abortion, islam or political opponents, funding can be cut, ensuring high moral standards are maintained throughout the land.  In a socialist nation, the government funds schools and determines their curriculum - ensuring that all students learn the appropriate facts rather than controversial theories, ensuring the stability of the governing regime.  In a socialist regime the head of state is held to be deserving of respect and admiration from his subjects, ensuring a stable rule - those opposing actions taken by the government are regarded as "unpatriotic" and "appeasers".   In this way it is easy for a socialist nation to wage war and ensure foreign nations have friendly governments, where a less socialist government may not have the funding to maintain a high-tech global police force.
 There are democratic socialist groups which are also revolutionary (though not necessarily violent). Their aim is to set up parallel democratic structures that ultimately make the apparatus of the current state irrelevant.  Which is essentially what happened during, and since, the recent Argentinian economic collapse of 2001. While the government was still clinging to power, people organised themselves, first in small local units, then larger local units, then regional, and finally national. At every stage councils were set up representing the people at whichever level, and made real decisions which helped the country back on its feet while the government was essentially impotent. Not the best example, because the government was already in dire straits as the socialist movement grew, but this is a real model of grassroots socialism, power by the people, for the people.
I think you're mixing up socialist and fascist. Patriotism is anathema to socialism.  Fascism is a form of socialism, the most common (and pragmatic) form. We might refer to it as National Socialism rather than intenational socialism if you want to make a distinction.
By definition the most venerated entity in a fascist regime is the state. In a socialst regime it is the people.   What the people most venerate in a state doesn't determine what that state is, you could have a fascist regime where the most venerated entity is Allah, or a socialist regime where the most venerated entity was Stalin.
So a free society is one where the goverment does not have tabs on their citizens?  That's not the definition of a free society, but it is one of its attributes.  How could then the goverment work  Government does not work; that's why it is important to minimise it.  And since when was there a dichotomy between freedom and socialism?  Since the words had meaning.  Wouldn't it be rather MORE risk to be rounded up if you couldn't identify yourself and thus automatically become suspect  Yes, absolutely. Under a regime where identification papers must be presented on demand, anyone who for whatever reason does not have those papers on them becomes suspect, liable to be rounded up and imprisoned.
 Not necessarily. I don't think that they have a real problem with freedom in Sweden.   Sweden, like most of the western world, runs on a mixed economy. To the degree that it is socialist, it is not free, just like in the rest of the world. Surprisingly Sweden generally ranks quite highly on the sorts of "economic freedom index"s that are published from time to time. Now say what you will about the arbitrariness of weightings in such indexes, what I take from them, at least, is that in some ways Sweden is much more free, and less socialist than the likes of the US or western europe.  I am not intimately familiar with Sweden, but my first reaction to it is that it differs more in the kind of socialism it embraces than the degree to which it embraces it.  Socialism is NOT a political system, it is an economic system.  I disagree. Socialism is not an economic system, it is the absence of an economic system.   The absence of an economic system can only be maintained through a totalitarian state, and any "socialist" nation therefore has certain political attributes. It is not itself a political system; there are many particular ways by which free enterprise can be suppressed, and therefore many governments that may rightly be called socialist, we have seen the German model, the Italian model, the Soviet model, the Korean model, the Cuban model, the Chinese model, and we are seeing the American model's beginnings now. Some we call Communists, some we call Fascists, some National Socialists, some Theocracies, some Democracies but they are all socialist.  What you describe here is fascism, which you claim is essentially the same as socialism.   It is not the "same as" socialism, it is a form of socialism.  Mussolini, who essentially was the father of fascism, formed the fascist party in Italy after being expelled from the socialist party.  Undoubtedly they disagreed about the form Italian socialism was to take. The socialist party presumably wanted a form of socialism built around the working class; private economic activity would be abolished and resources distributed to the poor. Mussolini presumably preferred private economic activity be abolished and resources funneled into the government apparatus itself, the military and bureaucracy.
Sweden has been officially socialist since 1932.   Funny isn't it, how what things are "officially" is so different to what they are in reality.  Socialism is, by definition, an economic system.   I disagree.  What you are trying to do is pick the worst examples you can think of and say "THAT is socialism". This is similar to me pointing to Zimbabwe and IRan and saying THAT is democracy...or pointing at Nigeria or the Sudan and saying "THAT is capitalism".  I'm trying to pick any examples of places where socialism has been implemented. That they all happen to be terrible places I can't be blamed for.  By definition, the socialist economic system is built around the working class.  This is untrue, the capitalist economic system is built around the working class. McDonald's, Nike, Walmart, Ford, 99% of the productive capacity of capitalist society is dedicated to consumption goods for the working class.  It is essentially ALL private enterprise directed by the state  I gather by private enterprise directed by the state, you mean that private enterprise has been abolished and replaced with state enterprise, ie socialism.  That the names and the language of business is used is of no relevance to the reality of fascism, which is the same as under all forms of socialism, private, free exchange is abolished. There may still be goods in stores, but the government determines their price. People may still be employed, but the government determines their wages and positions. Businessmen may still run businesses, but what they produce, how much they pay their workers, is determined by the government.  This form of socialism is more effective because it makes full use of the resources and social structures which already exist, rather than tearing them all down and starting anew.  One of the first thing Mussolini did under his regime was break up all the labor unions and execute supporters of organized labor.   The first thing all socialists do, when they seize power, is to eliminate the advocates and potential champions of other forms of socialism.   This is COMPLETELY at odds with the socialist ideal where all means of production are owned and actively managed by organized labor.  This is not the socialist ideal, it is one of many. Other socialists idealise the means of production owned and actively managed by people of pure Germanic blood.  In summary, socialism comes in many different shapes and colours, and it is no more valid for a socialist of one variety to assert that other varieties are "not socialism" than it is for a Protestant to assert that a Catholic is "not Christian".
One of the biggest problems with socialism is the cradle-to-grave government provision. This quashes the entrepeneurial spirit and the drive to improve one's lot in life.
"directed capitalism" is nothing but a euphemism for socialism. There is no difference, when the government directs production, whether the businesses retain the title of businesses or they are renamed as government departments. A rose by any other name is still a rose.  You REALLY need to run, don't walk, to your nearest institute of higher education and take some classes in political science.  Argument from authority is logically invalid. I have no doubt various political science classes would teach something similar to what you are saying, I have been in classes which did. That many people and institutions are wrong does not make them right, and it is no surprise that socialist institutions, like public higher education systems, would attempt to distance themselves from fascism.
One is socialism, one is directed capitalism. By definition they are different, and they are mutually exclusive.  I disagree. Although they have different names, they are in essence the same.  Business being owned primarily by the government is also not socialism.   On the contrary, that is the very essence of socialism. Either that or all business is abolished except the business of government. Whether there is only one business, the government, or there are many businesses, and all of them are controlled by the government, "directed capitalism", there is only a cosmetic difference  Whether the managers of government industry are designated as "workers" in Cuba or "shop managers" in Germany, and whether the businesses are called "businesses" or "collectives" or "the department of agricultural prosperity" is of no essential import in distinguishing one socialist state from another.  From a practical standpoint, a true socialist economy essentially prohibits government ownership of anything.  Whoever is able to prohibit "government ownership" in a socialist society, ie some kind of "workers collective" in effect is the government of that society. You may as well say that in Germany there was no government control because the Nazi Party displaced it.  . As Alan points out above, socialism was supposed to be a transitional step between capitalism and the anarcy of pure communism.  In the apparent view of Marx and some socialists, but not in the view of others. Socialism neither began or ended with Marx, and there are many varieties of it with distinct qualities from the Marxist model (with its own various interpretation).  Furthermore when Marx spoke of the end of the state, he defined the state as the exploitation of one class by another, so a society without classes would neccessarily be without a state. Marx's "anarchy" is anarchy only by way of an unusual definition of the word state, it is not an actual anarchy at all.  The following words actually have definitions:  Capitalism Directed Capitalism Socialism Fascism Communism  I put it to you that I understand the definitions of these words, and that you are confusing the definition of socialism with what you believe to be its implications.   When socialism fails to meet what you believe to be its "goals" (even though economic systems do not themselves have goals, and different people advocate socialism for different reasons), you declare that it is not socialism, but something else. When you declare something to be "a long way from the socialist ideal", that is only your ideal of socialism, other socialists have different ideals (which is why they fight each other so much).  You essentially seem to want to define anything that is not unrestricted free market capitalism as "socialist". This is just stupid. There are a LOT of different systems out there that fit neither the definition of free market capitalism or socialism.  I would call most societies today mixed economies, having some socialist and some capitalist elements. There are a few societies which are almost entirely socialist in nature, and a few which are almost entirely capitalist.  You do not pave the way to anarchy by installing an all controlling, totalitarian government.  I agree, those who believe in a socialism and anarchy are deluding themselves. Socialism can only be implemented through total government, and total government does not lead to anarchy. Although, then again it sort of does, at least temporarily, as socialist governments tend to collapse.
Unregulated capitalism is quite horrifying - to the owners of large corporations. They are forever at the mercy of the whims of consumers and the advances of rivals, all of whom are attempting to undercut their prices, improve upon their products and take their customers at every turn. Business is cuthroat, and no company will likely stay at the top for long.  The state offers them a means by which a large corporation can be permanently entrenched, they can be granted a monopoly and their losses insured.  Wal-Mart for example, is a strong advocate of raising the minimum wage, not, of course, because they wish to pay their workers more (they could do this themselves of course, voluntarily, without their being a law), but because they wish to drive out of business smaller competitors who cannot afford the same monetary wages as Wal-Mart offers (even though they may offer better working conditions in other respects, eg a less hectic workplace, closer location to home etc).  Intellectual support of socialism is similarly self-serving. In a free society the role of political scientists, economists, and politicians themselves is fairly unimportant, they may catalogue a history of economic events, teach that history to students, make forecasts. But in a socialist state their positions are of much greater importance and grandeur - the intellectuals take on the role of "social planners", they must decide what everyone else must do, what projects and technologies should be pursued, where resources should be allocated, etc.  In a more immediate sense, the intellectual who takes on such a "planning role", even in a more limited sense, will easily find employment, by the government, than one who confronts ideologically the justification for taking any measures at all. For example, an intellectual who today writes a paper on "How to win the war in Iraq: psychological warfare in the 21st century" will easily find himself a highly paid member of the military industry, while one who suggests we withdraw from Iraq will not. Or more distantly, Keynes rose to prominence after the German government promoted him as "Britain's greatest economist", for declaring that the reason for Germany's economic hardship were the reparations it was orderered to pay. In this way, if ten individuals set out with honest intentions, some socialist leaning and some not, it is the socialist ones who will be promoted, by the government, as great thinkers.  Of course, exposure to political and economic theory can swing a person either way. But this is the primary reason, in my view, that so many intellectuals and "business leaders", with little exposure to theory at all, support an increased role for government.
Interesting that you have no problems defining socialism (=evil) in a breath but squirms when encouraged to explain your own pet political system of choice.  I did not define socialism as evil. Nor was I asked to explain a free society. I was asked a yes or no question, whether the government not keeping tabs on its citizens was the definition of a free society, a question which I answered for you more than adequately. If you have any followup questions, feel free to ask them.   So whether an enterprise is wholly owned by the workers operating it, or owned by the government it is all the same?  That depends what you mean by "wholly owned". If they "wholly own" it, then they can sell it, and if they can sell, the system is capitalist, not socialist. But in the societies we are talking about, workers or "shop owners" who "wholly own" things "wholly own" them in name only. In reality the government retains real ownership, and only allows others to use them under conditions it specifies. The reality is the same, only the name has changed.  There is only ONE system which can truly be defined as socialism, and that is the socialist theroy generated by Marx. Just like there has only ever been ONE truly fascist regime, and that was Mussolinis.  And there is only one religion, and it is Christianity - everything else is a cult, right?  Weren't you the one directing me to read Wikipedia as a source on socialism? I thought this meant you had read it and agreed with it yourself, obviously not..  The word "socialism" dates back at least to the early nineteenth century. It was first used, self-referentially, in the English language in 1827 to refer to followers of Robert Owen. In France, again self-referentially, it was used in 1832 to refer to followers of the doctrines of Saint-Simon and thereafter by Pierre Leroux and J. Regnaud in l'Encyclop&#233;die nouvelle. Use of the word spread widely and has been used differently in different times and places, both by various individuals and groups that consider themselves socialist and by their opponents. While there is wide variation between socialist groups...  By the time of the Revolution of 1848 there were a variety of competing "socialisms", the most influential being those founded by Saint-Simon, Owen and Charles Fourier. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels by this time were referring to themselves as "communists", in large part to distinguish themselves from the above ideologies, which they described as "utopian socialism". (Engels later used the term "scientific socialism" to describe Marxism.)...  Depending on the context, the term socialism may refer either to these ideologies or any of their many lineal descendants.   Thankyou for demonstrating why there are so many internal conflicts between socialists, each declares their brand of socialism is the only true socialism and that all the others are not real socialists at all, but capitalist sympathisers.   all governments tend to collapse  Because all governments, once established, tend towards socialism.
So taking care of the less fortunate is a bad thing? No, but it should be under the purview of the church and not for profit charities. Government intervention in this has been nothing but a boondoggle.  The drive to improve one's lot in life is a flawed concept to begin with. It leads to greed which is heart and driving force behind capitalism. So you think that I should just give up trying to make a better life for me and my family, huh? Keep working for next to nothing while the government continues to siphon more money out of my hard earned paycheck, eh?
I don't know: I am a upstanding educated man who wants nothing more than to be a husband, father, and provider given the right woman.  I have seen several women with whom I have been involved go off to become the single mothers of other men's children. A woman who has sole responsibillity for a child is IN FACT a less valuable employee on account of the time she will need to take off to care for that child. Knowing that there are at least three women out there who have chosen single motherhood with the progeny of less responsible men over a life with me, why should I sympathise with their like in this?
It's not rhetoric, it is true that single mothers earn less.  I am just asking why this is innapropriate? If an employer knows that an employee is going to take more time off and cost more in health care, why shouldn't that employer pay that person less?
During my business years single mothers were generally far more reliable than the average employee without that particular burden. They couldn't afford to miss work and normally had support systems in place for emergencies. Nor were they paid less than anyone else with identical education and skill sets.  This mirrors my own experience. Single mothers and fathers, or fathers who are the sole provider, tend to be more reliable.  I can't help but wonder what methodology was used in the cited study. It is not explained anywhere I could find. As a cross section of society, I would imagine that single mothers tend to make less for the same reason that women tend to make less....because they curtail their own advancement. They are uninterested in doing the 70-90 hour weeks that are required of management in many scenarios, so they do not seek higher paying jobs.
I think that in reality you both are right, and single mothers earn the same wage as others in any given job-category. We are really looking at a situation where single mothers have less "career flexibillity": The abillity to complete additional years of schooling, the abillity to relocate often, the abillity to work extremely long or irregular hours.  Without this "career flexibillity" they simply have fewer tools to use in advancing to better paid job-categories.
THe only "solution" that I am aware of to this is socialism. As george aptly points out, a large contingent of "working poor" is simply a byproduct of capitalism. The swedes and large portions of Europe have shown that socialism can work, but it is unlikely that we would or even could implement such a system here. Socialism does not fit well with a culture of conspicous consumption.   We are what we are and we live under the syatem that we have, not the system that you might wish we had. That being the case, if you wantt o excell under our system, you have to play by the rules of the game.
Nonsense. Without a certain measure of wealth leisure time is dissipated with mundane amusements. Far better to be skiing great powder runs, sailing oceans and enjoying other privileged pursuits than watching TV or mowing a lawn.   While money may not be able to buy happiness, it can buy time, transportation, and equipment, as well as making most of life's more mundane problems vanish.   If you cannot be happy when unencumbered with problems and while possessing the ability to pretty much go anywhere you want to go and do anything you want to do, you have serious psychological problems and should probably buy some therapy then go back and try it again. The up side is that you should have no trouble hiring the best therapists money can buy, assuring a recovery
if accumulation of wealth is a primary goal, you have a worthless life :) You are entitled to your opinion, but what/who determines the criteria for "worthless"? If a man devotes his life to the accumulation of wealth and is happy in his pursuit .... is his life worthless? If his pursuit results in expanded commerce, jobs, products, knowledge ..... is his life worthless? I have known men who worked every day to accumulate wealth, but their net worth was just the way they kept score .... the fun for them was the race, not the purse. They seemed to be happy with their "worthless" lives and their checks to me and other employees never bounced. Dono
I'd like to see how much wealth you can take with you to your grave. I will take out exactly the same amount I came in with; as will you. I have known real poverty and some affluence, but wealth has never been my primary goal and I was not defending myself in my remarks about your assessment of what is "worthless". I simply questioned the veracity of your statement and asked a couple of simple yes or no questions.  Dono
You bought time? I doubt this. You are going to live X years. No matter how much money you have you will not be able to extend that.  Sure I did. I retired 30 yrs earlier than most people. I now have the majority of my life to do whatever I wish. I have bought all the free time in the world.   Even the idea that you cannot extend your life due to wealth in incorrect. Your life expectancy increases with your income bracket. Look it up. Didn't you ever wonder how guys like Warren Buffet, Allan Greenspan, Dick Cheney, etc... manage to be out white water rafting, and hunting, and running huge companies well into their 70's and 80's (and sometimes even 90's)? They are getting better medical care than your HMO is willing to pop for.    People that live by money die the most unsatisfied people. I have never met a happy person that seeked wealth yet I know many that are wealthy.   This is a lie that poor people and the middle class tells themselves. The vast majority of wealthy people I have known who are unsatisfied are suffering from boredom. Right now I am bored and unsatsfied. I am thinking of taking up hovercraft racing. I have a design that I think will just dominate the field.    Far better caring for the things that matter in life than worrying about working 80hrs a week so you can ski once a year.  You are missing the point. You work 80 hours per week until you have accumulated enough wealth, then you flip the corporate world the bird and wander off to do whatever the hell you want. By then you should have established enough wealth and expertise that you can simply put your holdings in autonomous investments and cash the checks every 6 months, or at least give them minimal attention.  The other thing that you are missing is that nmost people who work 80+ hours per week do so because they love the game.   Personally the only thing I miss about working is working. I LOVE the game. Nothing is more exciting. Your net worth is just a score card and insurance that your kids will have a chance to play.   I used to have the "neglecting the family" argument with my idiot brother in law. He is a teacher and never has any money. He goes home form work and does things like cut the grass, paint the house, chore type things, then sits on his butt and watches football because by the time he gets done working and done with all the honeydo XXXX, he is tired. His kids play in the play room alone.   Even when I would work long hours (often I had the kids at the office with me, but that is another argument), I would spend more time with my kids than he did. I would be at the office later, but then come home and watch dora or have tea parties or whatever becuause while I was at work, somebody else painted the house, mowed the lawn, did all the chores and honeydo's.   While there are certainly those who neglect their families, theya re the minority and either do not like their fmailies all that much, or are playign out of their league.  Face it. Life is better with money.

Life is better with money.  I couldn't agree more Daewoo.  Here's my take - wealth isn't the primary goal, family, happiness, and health are the TRUE goals, but by making wealth the primary goal, you facilitate the TRUE goals in life.  As for money not buying happiness, I can't believe people still use that line. Imagine the happiest period in your life. Now imagine that period if you would have had the means to do everything you desired at the time. Now imagine you had the means to do everything your friends and family desired at the time and now.......but money can't buy happiness.  As for "you can't take it with you", no, you sure can't, but you can leave it to your children and family. Providing them with that head start will make sure they have the means to reach their TRUE goals.  Waxy
I've seen a few studies on the links between wealth and happiness, they generally suggest that once you get past the "comfortable" point financially (i.e. you don't have difficulty affording housing, food etc.) the amount of money you have makes very little difference.   I would agree with this. Unfortunatly the "comfortable" point is much higher than most people realize.
No you don't. By making it a goal you can potentially facilitate the true goals. If it is made the primary goal, these true goals will fall to the wayside as they are not the primary goals. You even seem to acknowledge this somewhat later in your post by recognizing it as a means, not an end.   In reality wealth is difficult enough to accumulate that unless you make it your primary goal, you end up in the middle class making do. IF, on the other hand, you make it your pri ary goal you really only have to make enogh to get to the point that it is self perpetuating. Then you just have to be either smart enough to invest it yourself (which by then you should be based on the knowledge you will have acquired in gaining your wealth) OR smart enoguh to choose a portfolio manager that can handle things for you.
You think it's impossible to obtain this level of wealth without making it your #1 goal in life? I don't see a reason to believe that this is the case.  Secondly, you don't believe that it is possible for everyone to do this do you?  I think you are underestimating the amount of time, dedication, and work that such a thing takes.  Can anybody do it? Of course! Well....ok...a certain level of intelligence is required, but not much. All you really need is the drive and the willingness to work hard. I do not mean 40 hrs/wk hard, I mean 80 hrs /wk and always on call hard. You also have to be able to face realities, even unpleasant ones, and you must without question be able to make difficult decisions (firing, etc...) even when it is unpleasant.
If you are working 80 hrs/wk and you have a family, you can't possibly be giving them the time and attention they need and deserve. And they need and deserve your time more than they do your money.  BS. Even when I was working 90-100 hrs /wk I was devoting mroe time to my children than most people who were only working 40 hrs /wk  Second, my point in asking "you don't believe that it is possible for everyone to do this do you?" was to say that in a capitalist system, there are inherintly going to be people on the bottom. It is unavoidable. So to say that it is possible for everyone to do this is absurd.  I did not say that everybody could do it. I said that anybody could do it. BIG difference. There will always be plenty of people unwilling to put in the hours and work required to do it.
So you must have been working through the night so you could see your kids during the day. You couldn't have been sleeping. Well there are several possible explanations for this, but I'll be nice and just mention two. 1) You're a medical anomoly that doesn't need sleep 2) Cocaine, meth, or mainlining caffeine  Lets not forget the most likely, which is like just abiout every former special forces soldier on the planet, I adapted to get by on less sleep, something that anybody can do. A few miserable weeks and you, too, could be a "medical anomoly" like hundreds of millions of other people.  Unwilling people has got nothing to do with it. If everyone in this country was willing and able, it would still not be possible just by nature of how capitalism works.  And if purple elephants fell out of the sky some people would be crushed and be unable to do it. Stop making excuses. Not everybody would do it because most people are simply too lazy. Working as hard as they needed to to in order to meet their full potential woudl mean less time to sit on their butts and watch football and whose the biggest fatass. The fact that there can be some mretty major rewards down the road for such dedication (like the ability to fly to any football game you want to see it) is too long range a concept for most people.   Besides, beyond the whole issue of time sacrifice, people would also have to moderate spending to assure that they are not spending so much as to waylay their goals. This means a postive savings rate so you have money to invest. That would mean looking at the wider view. Americans want everythign and want it NOW. They want new houses, new cars, new gadgets and gizmos. Depriving themselves of these things in the short term for broader gain in the long term is not a concept that most can grasp.
I don't understand the unfamiliarity with 80-hour executive workweeks. 14-hr days including the short Saturday were never considered abnormal, even without travel, due to the US difference in time zones. If you did business in NY and California, there's 11-hours right there. Toss in international time zones and clocks only meant what time it was in other places. Travel easily stretched them out to 100-hours and beyond. I understand that would be foreign to hourly workers, most staff, all government employees and education, but do people actually think they should be entitled to above normal acheivement measured by wealth for working 8-10 hours a day? 8-10 hour days are for after goals have been achieved and regular jobs. Those were the conditions that normally precluded a working single mother from competing at the executive level.   Personally, I always was in the office from 6AM-8PM (central) mon-fri then worked from home on the weekends. I never really thought it was an excessibve work load, just what had to be done to get ahead and stay ahead.   From many of the posts I'm reading and the state of the US and European economies, many have changed the balance of effort from stressing professional endeavors to personal time. Complete with demands for high standards of living on minimal effort. Chinese, Indian and other emerging economies are eating your lunches for obvious reasons.  "World owes us a living" disorder. I don't think that the situation we are in has impacteed most Americans yet. Judging from the way the dollar is going, and other economic indicators (such as a 75% increase in home foreclosures last month), I would say that winter is coming and the grasshoppers are screwed.   This just came across my news ticker:  [FELDSTEIN], Harvard Univ prof, in an interview with the Nikkei Shimbun says Dlr needs to decline to the level US consumers shift their purchase to US goods from imports so that consumption slowdown does not affect GDP. He says in order to cut trade deficits to the level external debts/GDP ratio does not increase, Dlr might need to fall 30-40% according to an estimate, and introduces the fact Dlr lost 40% of its value in the 1980's when US c/a deficits/GDP ratio was smaller. He sees China can accept Yuan strength once it can prevent spec funds inflow, and stresses Jpn should not intervene to avoid US's conservatism. He says US econ would slowdown if savings rate rise and trade deficits stay unchanged. Note there have been rumors recently he would succeed Snow.   Personally, I don't think it is likely that we will be able to revalue the dollar 30-40% without crashing it. Central banks have made it pretty clear that they are not going to sit idly by holding our dollars while we devalue their currency reserves by 40%. If we see a massive dollar sell off, which is not out of the question, a 40% revaluation would quickly become a 60-70% devaluation.  Show of hands (or at least somethign for people to think about), how many here can continue their lifestyle making 30-40% less?
You seem to be completely missing my point. I'm not making excuses for anyone. I am simply saying that it is inherent, in fact necessary, for some to not be able to accumulate wealth in a capitalist system.  I understand. What I am saying is that those poeple are volunteers, and there is never any shortage of them. The reason that ANYBODY can do it is becuase the vast majority will not. It does nto take that much to get ahead of your fellow man, especially in the US. I have met a lot of peopel who have millions, or even hundreds of millions of dollars who are ocmplete and utter XXXXXX. Lacking brains, what they DO posess is the willingness to work towards a goal and just enough common sense to let thoe more knowedgable handle their affairs.
I heard a funny story that many many moons ago fathers took care of their families. Is this true, or is it just a rumor? Maybe mothers are in trouble because so many of them are single mothers. Maybe they are single mothers because the fathers skipped out. Maybe the fathers skipped out because they were told that the kids would be able to live on welfare.
if accumulation of wealth is a primary goal, you have a worthless life :)  LOL, well, while I'm living in my million dollar mansion kicking back by the pool drinking margaritas and then hopping in my Ferrari to take a spin around the block, you can tell me how worthless my life is. You sound like you are just bitterly jealous of people who are actually successful.   The idea that you have to make a choice between work OR family is ludacris. I work so I can actually enjoy my leisure time. If you don't have money, how do you afford to raise a family and participate in leisure activities? Living costs money, period. I want to provide the best environment and future I can for my family, so I work hard. Guess what? I used to live off of $12,000 a year. That is $1,000 a month, about $250 a week. This is chump change. If I can live of that, ANYBODY can...unless you make poor decisions and end up with kids that you can't afford or you are just poor at money management. People need to accept responsibility for their lot in life and stop blaming everything and everyone else for their failures. If you are motivated enough, anybody can succeed in America. That is why this country is great. If you don't succeed, it is usually because you are lazy or unmotivated. If you want to spend the rest of your life being a victim and blaming everyone else, go ahead. It isn't capitalism that creates poor people, it is human nature that creates poor people. Even if you get rid of money, something will still be valuable to humans....land, food, water, bullets, etc. And the people with the most of theses things will have power and control. This holds true with any economic system. America allows the most individual freedom of choices, but people want the government to hold their hand and they have a bizarre sense of entitlement. This is what doesn't make any sense to me. After hurricane Katrina hit, we saw how effective the federal government is at helping people. And these are the same people you want to hand over your healthcare and finances to? No thanks!
I'll be sure to remind them to bury your car and mansion with you when you die.  Everybody dies, but not everybody truly lives my friend. What is wrong with wanting to have a good life while we are here on earth?
I'll be sure to remind them to bury your car and mansion with you when you die.  I think that DrNo needs to update his life goals. It has been a long time since a million bucks would buy a mansion. At best a million $ will buy you a McMansion...and unremarkable home in a subdivision of unremarkable homes made out of cardboard and sawdust (though we call it "MDF" and "masonite" to make people feel better about their McMansions).   Sadly, burying him in his McMansion is not an option since cardboard siding is not burial rated and decays fairly rapidly due to ground contact. I am all for bulldozing and burying McMansions. Using them as a casket is just not an option. They are not built well enough.
So what is the downside to burying someone in a McMansion again?  Only that it would not last long underground. Then again, they don't seem to last very long above ground, either, and since they are eyesores anyway, I say go for it.   Have you ever seen one burn? They go up like the cardboard packing crates that they are. My father used ot own the largest residential construction company in the state before selling it off due to housing market slowdowd. He still owns a VERY profitable business that does nothing but replace the cardboard siding on McMansions when they are 8-15 yrs old and the siding starts to fail and flake off.
I have never found living to include trying to impress the neighbors with my ego.  Me either. It's funny you would bring up impressing the neighbors. I think that says more about your ego than mine. I could care less what other people think of me. Why do you associate wealth with ego? Because I don't want to live in a shack and scrape together loose change from the couch to buy a XXXX meal from a burger joint (which I have done in the past), that makes me egotistical? Because I strive for success and try to be the best at what I do, that makes me egotistical? Because I want to live comfortably in a nice home (preferably with NO neighbors to your apparent surprise), that makes me egotistical? There is nothing noble about being poor. Being poor sucks. And there is nothing egotistical about being wealthy.
I actually agree with DrNo here. It is definatly more fun to be rich than poor. I have tried both and certainly prefer wealth. Can you buy happiness? Maybe, maybe not. Money will make most of lifes problems go away, though, and if you have enough it ensures that you can have just about anything you want.  Still, DrNo, mansions start at about $120 million.

I prefer Tony Robbins' take on wealth. It doesn't solve all of your problems, but you can arrive to them in style.
 You can build a nice house for less than 1 million. The key is to make sure you live out in the country where land is cheap ;). I lived in a planned community growing up...and while it was a "good" enviroment to grow up in, after you realize eveyrone there is full of themselves and annoying as hell you can't go back :)  Absolutly. DrNo specifically said "mansion" and you are not going to get a mansion for a million bucks. My house was well under a million dollars if you don't include land, outbuildings and my wifes rediculously expensive garden. I think it is nice, but at 8700 sq ft, nobody is going to be calling it a "mansion". It is just a house with a rediculously expensive garden.   I grew up in the burbs and I HATE the burbs. I LOATHE the burbs. My brothers and sisters all live in cookie cutter houses in the burbs. I don't even like to go there to visit. I would rather live in a tent than live in a McMansion.  When I was in college I framed houses during the summer. I used to go out on callbacks to fix problems in houses we had already built and sold. It always amazed me how many people had a $250,000 house with 2 $30,000 cars in the driveway, a big screen TV and leather furniture in the living room, and an air matress on the floor upstairs to sleep on and cabinets full of tuna because they blew all their money on the stuff that the neiborghs could see and then could not afford a bed or decent food. What a bunch of XXXXXX.
haha too true. My favorite house is one my grandfather built in Edenton, NC. Around it are a bunch of freaks that keep on trying to impress the other but my grandfathers house was this little house on pylons with 3 bedrooms and 2 baths. The house was awesome eventhough it was small. Now, the thing was built like a rock...so when a hurricane passed by a few years ago, guess whos house was left standing (these homes are on the water by the way)? Lets right....all those big trying to impress the neighbor homes got washed away or damaged while my small humble house stayed with no damage ;)  My house is built of limestone blocks except for the front, which is brick. I had to bring in masons from out of state to construct it. It should last several hundred years as long as somebody replaces the slate roof every hundred years or so. The best part is that I never have to paint :)  Personally I have never understood the "keeping up with the joneses" mentality. Too many people try (and succeed) at living far beyond their means and it seems they are primarily just trying to one up the guy next door. I personally have never had any overriding desire to "show up" andybody by buying junk that I cannot afford and do not really need.   Don't get me wrong, I like my creature comforts and my toys. I buy them for me, not because I want the yuppie sum next door to see it and be jealous.
Limestone huh? My former college uses limestone in all their buildings. Expensive, but you won't be picking up the pieces 50 years from now after a massive hurricane...not that this university would get one.  Limoestone is the indigenous rock around here. I considred granite, but would have had to have it shiped in at nearly 10x the cost. The limestone was not much more expensive than brick would have been. Hurricanes are not generally a problem in Kansas. I like the way the old limestone buildings look, and it is a sold bit of engineering!
A friend asked my wife what kind of house I would want if I was inclined to build again. My wife answered, "The usual.... 2 bedrooms, 40-car garage".  Dono
Let what you do be what you love.  If it makes you money, all the better!
You got a picture of how it looks? I have been interested in seeing how limestone would look on a house...maybe I can do a google image search.  Where are you from that they don't have limestone houses?
Why so many bedrooms? There is a method to my madness ..... the second bedroom is for me when I get banished for spending too much time in the garage. Dono
I told you...I grew up in a suburb that wouldn't have them...went to a college that only had limestone buildings...I now live in an area that hasn't heard of anything but red brick and plastic siding.  You poor disadvantaged boy.   I do not have any pictures of my house online. Take a look at http://www.nps.gov/tapr/VirtualTour/VTmansion.htm  that is the tallgrass prairie preserve about 20 miles from here, and it is actually the old ranch house there that prompted me to go with limestone block. Note I say "limestone block" as opposed to old english limestone or any of a dozen other tyeps of limestone.  The front of the house is actually limestone up to about 4", then a marble accent band, then brick on to the top. My wife decided either last year or the year before that she wantes a korean garden (korean style anyway). We go that done, then she wated a wall around it, so I had a limestone wall put in around 8 acres. The wall actually joins the house and is about 8" tall. The front part (the part you see looking at the house) is limestone block. Then we switched to an old english type (rough stone) wall because it is cheaper, if not as astehtically pleasing, as the block (IMO).   The guesthouse is in the garden and is also old english style limestone construction. The wife wanted block, but I thought that block was too expensive for a guest house.  This is the flint hills, and is pretty much where limestone comes from. There are quarries all over the place and I can actually get limestone block (FOB) cheaper than brick. Rough limestone is literally free, but you need a better mason to install it to keep it from cracking. The wall around the garden was actually cheaper to do in limestone than it would have been to do a wrought iron fence and I think it looks much better.
If you are working 80 hrs/wk and you have a family, you can't possibly be giving them the time and attention they need and deserve. And they need and deserve your time more than they do your money.  Second, my point in asking "you don't believe that it is possible for everyone to do this do you?" was to say that in a capitalist system, there are inherintly going to be people on the bottom. It is unavoidable. So to say that it is possible for everyone to do this is absurd.  This isn't inherent to capitalism; this is inherent to people. It doesn't matter what economic system a society has in place. Something will be assigned value by the people (currency, land, livestock, etc.) There will be people with a lot of these valuables, people with a little, and people in the middle. This is unavoidable and has nothing to do with capitalism itself.  Also, contrary to your belief, capitalism is actually what gives everybody equal economical opportunity. Recognize your talents, develop a skill, and market this skill. Generally, the only thing that seperates a wealthy person from an average income person is determination. Most people simply aren't willing to put forth the effort and time required to accumulate wealth.

Jim,  The working class has shown themselves unfit to lead. What now?
Fortunately, the Bolshevik Revolution failed. 1989, the Berlin Wall came a-tumbling down, along with Soviet Ideology.  Communism is a failed philosophy and the free world has soundly rejected it.
Spin it all you want, but forced redistribution of wealth by government edict, whether by state ownership or cofiscatory taxes or whatever just does not work. To say nothing of the fact that there is no incentive to better one's self, no entrepeneurial spirit encouraged, and no quality of life outside of what the "state" dictates. George Orwell would be proud.
there are other models of communism than the soviet one. Redistribution can be coupled with business built on the collective model, like the co-op or John Lewis in the UK, communist doesn't have to mean Stalinist. I'm unfamiliar with Mr. Lewis. I have no faith in planned economies though. Nor do I support redistribution based on formulas that do not measure individual productivity.
The working class do rise up. They rise up and create their own business and then hire other working class.
Bingo!! Give the man a cigar.:) That's how captialism works. Nobody should expect the government to dole out a living. That's been my contention from the getgo.
Ouch. Please don't mention places like sweden where socialism has done quite well, or the fact that most of Europe runs under a mixed (socialist/capitalist system). It detracts from the "we defeated socialism" doctorine as well as the "socialism simply does not work" doctorine.   In the end, socialism and cpaitalism have both pretty much shown themselves to be failures. Neither has really delivered on their promise and no country has actually thrived under one or the other. The US did not grow to be the economic superpower it is today under strictly a capitalist system, it was after depression era social programs that the US really took off as an economic super power.   Since both systems have been shown to be complete and utter failures on their own, mixed systems have become fairly popular. There are, IMO, problems with mixed systems as well since I do not think it is possible to achieve and maintain an optimal balance between capitalism and socialism.  I think that eventually we will adopt a system which carries elements fo bothe but is completely different. It seems highly likely that in 100 or 200 years we will look back on both capitalism and communism as amusing but somewhat disturbing economic experiments. Both have fairly serious problems that their supporters are willfully blind to.  I'm sorry but you will have to explain to me how socialist/capitalist France can be considered doing well with an ailing economy and 15% unemployment rates. The budding Chinese economy is breaking out of its communist ties and vaulting toward capitalism and the country is seeing unprecedented growth while France becomes more and more socialist and dies a little more each day. Now how is it that capitalism is a misreable failure?  As far as the comment on the US only being prosperous because of the socialist reforms made in the 30's is completely ludicrous. I don't know if you have heard of the roaring twenties but that was an incredibly prosperous time for the United States with none of Mr. Roosevelt's reforms. Now, let's think of the great socialist reforms that Roosevelt made. How about we start with Social Security. What a great reform that turned out to be. Isn't that one of the biggest economic problems in this country today? If you take an historical-economic look back into the days of socialist reform, very little of the entire alphabet soup actually made a difference on the economy. It was the war that actually brought us out of the depression. Now, the SEC, FDIC, and Glass-Stegall Act were all reforms that were more or less safeguards from the severity of crashes but were not made to pull the economy out of the depression like the other reforms were. (CCC, NIRA, WPA, etc.) As history tells, legislation is not an economic panacea. It is usually a blight on economies. They stunt growth in order to rebalance money. They sacrifice efficiency with false promises of creating more equity. (If you want me to embellish on this statement I will but not in this post). Let's consider what government does to help make the economy boom. Cutting taxes, not messing with the minimum wage, lowering interest rates (in other words, lowering the artificial rate floor and allowing an equilibrium point to be reached), tax breaks for incentive, etc. All these things are ways of taking government out of the economy and when they do, people prosper. This is completely against socialist thinking because it means government is not giving handouts. It is through growth that the economy is strong and socialism does not cultivate growth. How can you grow when startup costs for a business are way too high because of the minimum wage or taxes being too high. Who wants to expand overseas to a country with higher taxes? No one. That is nipping growth not helping.   I would appreciate if you could open my eyes to what I am blind to being a capitalist.
 Face it. Capitalism is flawed. In fact, capitalist theory is flawed from the outset. Capitalist theory essentially depends on infinite growth. Infinite growth is not possible. It is not even possible, if for no other reason for the fact that we live on a finite planet.  But that is what is so great about capitalism. There can be infinite growth. The point of capitalism is to find a way for growth. That is what it inspires. When resources are used up, alternative resources are found. When those are gone, new methods are used. Do you think one person back in the early automobile times thought that their cars would run on corn? Or (coming in the future) water (hydrogen cells)? I doubt it. Did the early industrialists think that electricity could come from anything but burning coal? Again doubtful. Now we are searching the winds, sun, water, and even the atoms for that power. When you give people the incentive, they will find a way and that is the fundamental idea behind capitalism. That is why I believe it works. Fundamentally, it is sound.
I believe you would have to look back at the Roosevelt Administration (the other one) to see America emerging on the World's stage. President Theodore Roosevelt strengthened the Great White Fleet - not out of desire for conquest, but as a response to growing German militarism under Kaiser Wilhelm and the demonstrated prowess of the Japanese Naval arm. President Roosevelt negotiated an end to the Russo-Japanese war and prevented an early outbreak of war between Germany and France over possession of Morocco. He understood the strategic value of a canal linking the Atlantic Ocean with the pacific and took over construction from a foundering French effort.   Theodore Roosevelt presided over one of the largest industrial booms in American History. A devoted capitalist, he also saw the need for workforce reforms and used the bully pulpit to mediate a coal worker's strike in Pennsylvania and to break up the Northern Securities Trust. His efforts to create a "Square Deal" prevented communism from taking root in America. The Communist system can never take wind in a nation with a healthy prosperous middle class because communist depends on class envy. With no angry mob to storm the Bastille, communism simply withers on the vine. Roosevelt's reforms led to the increase in the middle class with an attendant decrease in interest in communism. It may be argued that TR, rather than RR defeated the Evil Empire.
The story of Ireland's recent success, I believe is through the capitalistic measures that have been taken.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland  http://www.economist.com/countries/Ireland/profile.cfm?folder=Profile-FactSheet  http://www.cato.org/dailys/04-21-03.html  All these sites have in them the same phrases like, "reducing regulation," "lower taxes," and "maintaining low inflation." Sounds like capitalism at work to me. The less government is involved, the better. And on the economist.com factsheet, you can see that GDP per head is on the rise meaning the overall standard of living is rising. None of the articles make much mention of this little fact either but the people of Ireland are now staying in Ireland. There was negative population growth for a long time because there was no opportunity or incentive to stay so the younger people were leaving. Now, there is positive population growth and the people are staying. Their taxes are significantly lower than many European nations while they are running a near balanced budget. Sounds like they have found a more optimal point on the Laffer Curve to me. This is my take on the situation in Ireland and I would be curious to see who agrees/disagrees with me and why. Please respond.
You missed the bits about huge quantities of EU subsidy then, I take it? Basically Ireland is more of a textbook case of the effectiveness of Keynesian economic theories, with the added benefit that Ireland doesn't have to pay a lot of the money back.  Sure they got a little jump start, but they aren't giving it all up and becoming socialist like the rest of the EU. EU is trying to get all kinds of more capitalism minded nations with them. They are reaching to the Eastern Eurpoean countries to get them to participate in the EU because they are actually making money. Even though they still have huge markets, countries like France and Germany are not near as effective in the modern markets as Ireland relatively speaking. No one wants to open up in those countries because they'd have to pay enormous taxes. And why can't they lower their taxes? Because being a socialist country requires that you spend every penny you have on cradle to grave insurance and permanent job insurance and other such ridiculous measures. Ireland is no longer hemorraging their younger generations like they have been in the past either, and why? Because Ireland has become an economic hot bed and not solely due to the subsidies, but mainly through the influx of big companies wanting to be there for the low tax burdens. You think if we cancelled the debt to Africa, that would end the Brain Drain? No. The debt would just run back up and people would still be leaving but that is not the case in Ireland.
