Yeah, those are pretty good, but there are funnier ones in my post in the Creationism vs Evolution forum.
bullsh*t. you do get critized for tlaking about god... any other god other than the christian god that is  I don't have too much to say on this debate because I don't really enjoy debating religion. I would like to respond to this though, because I've had a similiar experience. My sunday school teacher asked us why we thought "God" didn't punish people of other religions for not believing in him....I think we were supposed to answer because he is a merciful god. However, I asked why it couldn't be that all the Gods are really the same essence of God, just worshipped in different ways. My sunday school teacher told me that this absolutely could not be true and continued to shoot down my arguement. However, the only proof she could come up with was a quote from the ten commandments which I can't remember the exact words of...something about believing only in him and no other god....so, yeah, feel free to pick apart my arguement 'cause I don't really care....
Very good point. There is a great diversity of beliefs in the world. Raelians, for example, believe that humans were genetically engineered by aliens. From an objective point of view, that belief system is no less credible than Christianity.
A definition is the meaning of word that someone created using their own opinions. How strange. It seems that Habbit's definition of the word definition is meaningless. Physicists and chemists can define what they mean by the word "carbon," but according to Habbit that is just their opinion. According to Habbit, carbon can be a chocolate candy meant to be eaten in a car. That may be his opinion and he considers it as valid as specific definitions assigned to words used by experts in any given field. And, a circle could be called a circle in the English language, but I could make up a new language in which a circle would be called a square and a square a circle. But your new language would be meaningless. The definition of a circle or a square does not vary from language to language. Mathematical definitions are not matters of opinion but quite precise descriptions so that all mathematicians will understand what is meant when the term is used. The words may change but the meaning doesn't. Math is not opinion. It is not my opinion that a triangle has three angles. That is a matter of definition.  Apparently Habbit doesn't understand that substituting the words of another language does not change the concept. That sort of argument is basically ignorant XXXX.
No hay de que. Wait. I mean, de nada. Wait again. Those express the same thing in the same language with different words. I guess it must be a matter of opinion.
Habbit has been reduced to meaningless insults. He made a fool of himself by demonstrating his ignorance of language and now has nothing worthwhile to say.
Don't like it when the person you're arguing against can be as sarcastic as you are, huh? I understand, I get these types of whines all the time.   Not at all. Your answers were without content or meaning. There was no sarcasm. You snipped most of my remarks because you were unable to address them. You have no answers and have been reduced to insult. That means that you have lost the discussion and you know you have lost. Otherwise you would attempt meaningful answers. You have made yourself a fool with nothing but names and insults.
OK. I've got it now. I said: You have made yourself a fool with nothing but names and insults. but I would have been more correct to say: Shut up you retarded moronic idiot. You little whining baby, stop wasting my time you dumb fool.   At least you are aware of your own mental deficiencies.
My religion is a mix between Christianity, Buddhism and atheism   I believe in science, but I beleive it as the way that God created the universe.    Atheism has only one tenet, and you don't hold it.
Ness, Do you embrace the theology of Christianity, the morals, the ritual? What component?
Sounds like you're a deist mixed with a belief in reincarnation.
"My religion is a mix between Christianity, Buddhism and atheism so I have taken what I think is satisfying out of all three and made it into one."   - Sorry but I find that hard to beleive even if you substitue science for atheism.   Thanks for reading this  Always Stay Open Minded
many people hold your belief. about the buddhism thing; no. reincarnation is also held dear to those of the jahova's witnesses. they are 'christians'.  you are a considered a modern christian, due to your belief in science.
Gilligan, I'm not sure Jehovah's Witnesses can be considered Christians. Not in the accepted and traditional use of the word Christian. They do not believe in the divinity of Christ.
They do not believe in the divinity of Christ.  Whoa, they don't? What do they believe?
Whoa, they don't? What do they believe?  SAm, Check out this official Jehovah's Witness website:  http://www.watchtower.org/library/ti/article_06.htm   Make sure to read the section "God Superior At All Times" specifically the 3rd paragraph, although the entire article applies
 Probably the most wierd of my beliefs is that the person we view as God may be a member of an advance alien race capable of creating their own universes.  wow, thats a new one, sorta. someone told me jesus was an alein once. which makes sense cuz he didnt come from this planet. so are you saying there are more gods out there? maybe one for every planet with life on it.. hmm
please, correct me if I'm wrong, BUT:  Belief in God requires faith. Faith is by definition the absence of proof. Therefore a belief in God has no proof.   But that leads to the next question: What is proof?  Nope, I disagree. Belief in God requires faith only because there is no proof. The faith requirement is inherent in the lack of proof, not inherent in the nature of God.
Um, isn't the nature of God another belief? After all, there's no way to prove there is a "nature of God." To believe in God's nature you must believe in God, therefore we are back to the logical deduction that a belief in God has no proof. I think it's safe to say that if God exists, he has a nature. That's not really adding anything to the debate.
But that is all secondary to the point of proving God. Something that doesn't exist cannot have a nature. Therefore, to believe in one's nature, you must believe in the one. So essentially nature is irrevelant until the thing that acts is proven.   So, back to the drawing board. Belief in God = Faith = Absence of proof = Belief in God, no proof. Therefore, you cannot prove God while having faith.  Ah, but that's not what you said before.   Belief in God requires faith. Faith is by definition the absence of proof. Therefore a belief in God has no proof.   The top conclusion says you cannot prove that God exists and still have faith, which is certainly true. If you could prove God's existence than you wouldn't need faith, you'ld have certain knowledge. The lower conclusion says that proof of God's existence is impossible, because faith is a requirement. I don't believe that's true. If God felt like it, he could certainly make an appearance and prove his existence. He could manifest everywhere in the world simultaneously, perform a bunch of miracles, dispense some wisdom and then head back up to heaven. This would have a huge impact on religion , but it wouldn't change the nature of God. He wouldn't suddenly disappear because everyone knew he existed, rather than just having faith.
How do we know it's God?  The "demonstration" I gave was just an off the cuff example. Most working definitions of God say he's omnipotent and omniscient. That being the case, he would know exactly what demonstation would convince every specific person, and he could perform that demonstration. Or for that matter, he could simply implant certain knowledge of his existence in everyones minds. The point being, if God wanted to prove that he existed, being omnipotent, he ought to be able to do so.
i guess part of free will is that you can only "know" God exists by your own choice. if everybody were forced to be aware of God's existence then there would be no reward for being a believer.   To the best of my knowledge, and I could be wrong here, the Bible doesn't guarantee free will.    like i said, its either the bible is true and God's existence can never be proven, or the bible is false and God's existence can be proven. you cannot believe the bible is true and expect to ever hope to prove that God exists simultaneously. if you believe the bible, then you must accept that God's existence is nothing more than your faith telling you so.  Sure, I'll buy that.   however, if you dont believe the bible, then its ok to assume that God can possibly provide physical evidence of his existence. but why would you think God exists if you dont believe the bible?  I can think of a couple of reasons. First, maybe you follow a religion that doesn't use the Bible as its holy book. Let's not be too Judeo-Christian-Muslem-centric here. Secondly, perhaps you think that the Bible isn't the unadulterated word of God, but rather man's attempt to explain God. Thus, it could be mostly right, but with some mistakes.
 But that all depends on what your definition of proof is. The common athestic proof is concrete, and testable. Aka, God comes down and does a interview on Oprah and subjects himself to scientific tests. Your definition may simply be "miracles." Therefore, you cannot prove God exists simply by phenomana, nor can I prove that God doesn't exist simply by phenomana. You can say all of the events happening are proof of God, but my definition of proof is vastly different then yours.    Are you trying to say that if an omnipotent, omniscient being wanted to prove that he existed, he wouldn't be able to? I don't buy that. Granted, what might convince one person might not convince another, but he's omniscient. He knows what will be convincing for any given person. And he's omnipotent, so naturally whatever the convincing act is, he could do it.  And just to be sure I'm reading you correctly, when you say "definition of proof" do you actually mean "what constitutes proof"? The definition of proof is pretty well established, it's what people consider sufficient evidence to constitue proof that leads to debate.
 if the bible is true, and God cannot lie, then he, being omnipotent and omniscient, could not provide concrete proof even if he wanted to. because if he did, then faith would be non-existent, and God requires faith, according to the bible. therefore if God did provide proof that he existed, then it would nullify the bible. of course this is assuming that the bible is true...  Why do you keep bringing this point up? Granted, it's an interesting and valid argument, but we're discussing the existence of God, not the validity of the Bible. "God" does not necessarily mean the God described in the Bible, nor should any apparent contradictions in the Bible be used as evidence for or against the existence of God.
Well, first off it's entirely possible for the Bible to be completely wrong, and still have a God which interacts with humanity. Perhaps, for example, the Jews have it right. Or the Hindus, or Buddists, or Taoists, or even the followers of Voodoo for that matter. God, or Gods for that matter, could exist and interact with the world in a manner utterly different from that described in the Bible.  As for a God with no track record, that's also another distinct possibility, which shouldn't be ignored. Perhaps God did create the universe, but not for our benefit, as it were. He may have made the universe for reasons which have absolutely nothing to do with us, and we're just a side effect. God may be aware of us, but not particularly care about us one way or the other. Thus, no punishments, no rewards. Granted, not a comforting thought, but one which should be honestly addressed in any serious discussion of the topic of God's existence.
 if every written work that talks about God in history has been found illogical, then it maybe the very concept of God himself is illogical.  Carefull. Don't confuse the description of a thing with the thing itself. Even if no one has come up with a logically consistant description of God that shouldn't imply that the reason for that is the God himself is illogical.    furthermore, what possible benefit would there be to pursue knowledge about the existence of a God that does not interact with man? just for knowledge sake? and how do you suppose we find such knowledge if this God does not interact with man? This is a philosophy forum. Philosophy is about the pursuit of knowledge, regarless of its immediate "value". Logically speaking, an indifferent God is one possibility, and so should be considered. As for how we would invesitgate such a God, I don't have a clue in the world. But again, just because a possibility doesn't open up useful avenues for study doesn't mean it can't be true. It could, however, be dropped as a debate topic due to lack of interest. :)
 Are you so sure? That is quite a range you give. Some people are willing to debate anything, regardless of the proof. I ask, what is YOUR definition of proof?  You are correct there. I've had people refuse to accept my proofs no matter how convincing. But then again, I don't have supernatural powers.   I'll go with the definition I got from dictionary.com: 1. The evidence or argument that compels the mind to accept an assertion as true.  As you point out, some minds refuse to be compeled in certain directions, at least without extreme measures being taken. Like, for example, direct intervention by God.   But aliens exist in the realm of the natural. Therefore, they cannot be a act of the supernatural. The later part of your post is true.  This argument reminds me of a quote from Arthur C. Clarke: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.   I'm not sure if the inverse is true though. i.e., Any magic (miracle) is explainable as very high tech. After all, tech is still bound by the laws of physics, while presumably miracles aren't.
Ok, how's this for a defintion. If something obeys the "natural" laws, such as the laws of physics and chemistry, then it's natural. If it violates those laws, it's supernatural.   Of course, we don't know all the laws of physics, so we can't be absolutely sure if some thing is supernatural or not, but at least it's a working defintion.
fair enough, though obviously insufficient. its a very open definition, so its not that useful. how about "if something violates the KNOWN natural laws, then its supernatural". there is no natural law that explains object levitation, for instance, so that would be considered as supernatural for the sake of this discussion  The problem with that defintion is that as we learn more, we'll most likely be shifting thing from the supernatural to natural category. Your definition allows us to categorize everything, at the risk of being wrong about some things. My definition only lets us definitivley categorize natural things, with everything else being in the "maybe supernatural/maybe hi-tech" group.  Phrased that way, your definition does seem the most useful. It does let us point at something and call it supernatural, even if we may need to change our minds later.
So, regardless of which definition we use, we're still in the situation of not being able to point to any phenomena and being able to definitevly say that it's supernatural. And of course, even if it is supernatural, that doesn't mean that it must be divine.  This suggests to me that any proof of God's existence that is based on the examination of phenomena isn't going to work. Since we can't know that an event is supernatural, any proof that's based on that event will be suspect. I think we'll need to look elsewhere.
But as you pointed out before, people used to think things like thunder were supernatural. We know that we don't know everything about physics yet, so we can't be sure that any of those things you mention couldn't have natural causes. Anti-gravitons could cause levitation, extremely hydro-phobic polymers on your shoes could let you walk on water, etc.  We could certainly say that these things look supernatural, but like you said, our first instinct would be to try to find the natural cause. And even if we couldn't find one, that wouldn't mean that one didn't exist. Anytime we called something supernatural all we'd really be saying is we haven't found a natural cause yet.
yes, but then again, supernatural phenomenon could possibly have NO natural explanation and be genuinely supernatural. when we classify something as supernatural, we are saying "we dont know IF there is a natural explanation at all".  Exactly my point.  According to the title of this thread, the uber-discussion here is proof of God's existence. We both seem to agree that we can't really be sure if an event is supernatural or just hi-tech. My point is that if we're looking for proof of God's existence, then basing it on supernatural events won't work, for just that reason. We can't know, to a sufficient degree to qualify as proof, that an event is supernatural, and therefore evidence for God's existence.
of course they do. the distinction is clear. supernatural pertain to phenomenon for which no known natural laws can explain. of course there are no such phenomenon in reality, but they exist in the imaginary, and need the term to define them.  you might be more correct to say there is no distinction between "paranormal" and "supernatural"  I don't think that works. First off, I've always thought of "paranormal" as refering to things which would be natural if they existed, but it's generally assumed that they don't. For example, if big foot was real, he'd just be a big ape thing with a good instinct for hiding, perfectly natural. But it's generally assumed he's not real, so he gets classified as paranormal.   And I don't understand what you mean when you say that supernatural phenomenon don't really exist. Are you saying that they simply don't exist at all, or that phenomenon that look supernatural do happen, but they really all have natural causes.
So I kinda lost track. What are we trying to establish here then?
I've been reading some of Descartes. He presents an interesting argument in favor of the existence of God.   We have an innate idea within us of a supremely perfect being. We also have within us an innate idea of a triangle. It is obvious that the angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles. It is equally obvious that a supremely perfect being possesses all perfections. Existence is a perfection. Therefore God must exist just like the three angles of a triangle must be equal to two right angles.  What are your thoughts?  Are you suggesting God is a triangle... lol just kidding buddy emoticon_rolleyes
Are you suggesting God is a triangle... lol just kidding buddy emoticon_rolleyes  You should check the dates on the posts you reply to. That one is almost 10 months old.
You should check the dates on the posts you reply to. That one is almost 10 months old.  I know, I just couldn't resist lol... it was more for me than anyone else.
if god exists then which of your senses detects this god??... surely if the human being was created by god then wouldnt at least one of your senses detect him?? I am not asking this question to aggravate anyone I just want to know the answer, although im sure it will.  Why would you assume this? None of our senses detect radio waves, we need special machines to detect them, but they exist. If God created man and decided for some reason to stay hidded it would be trivial for him to design our senses so that we couldn't detect him. I don't know why he'd want to do this, I'm just saying he could.
In fact I would say it's pretty much a pre-requisite for mere human senses to be unable to detect somthing such as God.  I wouldn't go that far. If God wanted to, surely he could "tone down" his presence to something that we could perceive without melting our brains.  Not that I have one any more. Hrumph. emoticon_frazzled
What do you guys believe in, and why? Back up your beliefs, por favor. I'm gonna start off with something extremely general to **** some people off and get it started. Remember, this is just to get it started, i will explain myself agaisnt others later.  I dont believe in God, or at least not in the way that seems correct to some people. Any objections?  [Oh yea, and i am new to THESE boards, how do you create smilies and how to you do quotes at the bottom of your posts and how do you make quotes from other people (Bold and italics?)?? (Note: This is just a general question, not really part of the debate. Thanks! ^_^)]  Do you not think it's arrogant to enter a debate with "I'm here! I'm going to XXXX everyone off! Entertain me!" (although I use quotes I am suggesting a summary of what you said)  Perhaps you'd prefer playing with scorpions or doing something else.
God is whatever YOU, the INDIVIDUAL, believe it to be.
Sounds like you never met him, but you will( ultimately) either for salvation or for judgement.  I know, you him and satan have regular lunch dates and play golf 2 times a week. You don't seem to understand the statement I made.
The point, an individual must come to that place for themselves. We can educate, but must be careful in what we say. It is wrong to force a person to an immediate decision or to even attempt it. God died on the cross to give us the choice to accept him or not. Not to force us to accept him. If he wanted to force us to accept him he could have done that at creation without need for the cross.   Great post Epaphras, even from my point of view...but didn't jesus die on the cross? Does jesus = god?
Because the statement makes no sense  My statement makes no sense? Should I go back and post some of your previous statements? You want to talk about stuff that makes no sense! Listen, my statement meant exactly what it said. God is whatever the individual believes him to be. This means that if I think god is a 7 foot tall chinese man with red hair, then that is what god is to me. If you think god is a cosmic vapour, then that is what god is to you. If Epaphras thinks god is a 3 fold being, that is what god is to Epaphras. You asked in the original thread...What is god? Don't get upset or berate people of they give you an answer completely individual to them. What question could you ask and get a more personal answer?
Never......I understand what you was saying, now, however, just for clarification, God is just not some cosmic vapor to me   It was just an arbitrary example.  I can think of a few, anyways, Perhaps I should be more specific. We don't have to make up stuff(our thoughts) when his creation is all around us, and is us. Exploration/ Study of him, and personal testimony of contact.( Absolutes)   This is what I meant by saying "stuff that makes no sense". I am not saying that it is a rediculous statement, or that it is wrong....I am saying that I do not understand what you are trying to say. This is what Epaphras meant when he used the term "word salad" on another post. Your ideas do not come out clearly in your writing, and it is frustrating for people trying to read them...we have to try to interpret what we think you were trying to say.   Sounds like you never met him, but you will( ultimately) either for salvation or for judgement.   And this is what I was talking about. It seems that you ask a truely personal question, one in which the answer lies deep within all of us, then make it seem as if we are wrong for giving the incorrect answer. If you ask a personal question such as "what is god", expect all kinds of answers, and don't make people feel as if they are wrong just because they don't believe what you do.
Humans are about the furthest thing from perfect. The bible IS perfect, it's flawless. You can't take anything from it and prove it to be incorrect. The only thing that even comes close is misinterpretations of certain sentences.   What can you take in the bible and PROVE to be correct? And if you want to discuss interpretations, think about the fact that many christian sects have many different interpretations of the same text.
My point with this is that the toilets around the time of Jesus would have been holes in the ground that everyone shared use of, similar to those in the poorest regions of Africa, which result in Cholera and other such disease. Actually toilets would have been of the standard Roman design in use throughout the Empire. Namely a plank with holes above a drain with flowing water to carry away waste.

Mongooseholly.co.uk &bull; View topic - El Sur Down Under  by Winston Smith on Fri Feb 06, 2009 9:55 am    Now the time has come to 'switch off', to end that 'era' and to begin another one. Forums were a hiatus in my life and nothing else.   Anyway, this is it  Adios  WS
Ive had a few debates/arguaments with various people regarding god and religion. Ive argued about the existence and the meaning of a god.  I would like to know what people think are the origins of a god, where did he/she come from?  Why did they create us? What motivation would a supreme being have for creating humanity?  All interesting questions, can anybody attempt to answer them?
You guys are a little above my head on most of this, but I just wanted to add a little something.  Nobody, not even an "all-powerful supreme being" can do something that is impossible, because then it would no longer be defined as impossible.
I'm really curious to see who beleives in god for concrete reasons and who beleives in him by faith.
I'm really curious to see who beleives in god for concrete reasons and who beleives in him by faith. In reality, there are no concrete 'reasons' for believing in God. If you believe in God, you believe based on faith. There is no incontrovertible physical evidence anywhere to even suggest that God exists... unless you first believe through faith that God exists.
Okay, everyone. This post can live or die with this recommendation:  Tedster - if you will, please, when starting a debate about a belief, please do not include the word concrete. Even if you are talking about the driveway. Okay?   <Big Orn sighs...< My, appologies Orn, won't happen again.
Again, this is evidence only to suggest not prove. I cannot prove nor can anyone else. However, to say that there is no evidence even to suggest it is way beyond the realm of logic. If you wrote this in response to my post, please note that I said that there is no PHYSICAL evidence that suggests that God exists without the mindset that God exists.  Individuals who believe that God exists do not constitute physical evidence of God's existence. Their belief in God is the reason for their seemingly amazing actions. Their belief is in their mind (and/or their 'spirit'). It is based on faith. It is not based on physical evidence in reality.  The Bible is a book. It was written by human beings (allegedly inspired by God). What is written in the Bible are ideas that were in existence prior to being written down, or they could not have been written down. If there is a central theme of ideas for a segment of the population over a long period of time, the population will be able to continue to write of those similar ideas with great consistency. That still does not constitute physical evidence in reality that God exists. That is just evidence that a similar belief in God has existed over a 'long' period of time by a segment of the population.
People are people and by nature will glorify themselves or attempt to. This is an assumption you are making, and it is your opinion. There is no evidence I am aware of that indicates what IS or ISN'T an essential part of human nature. But if you have evidence that suggests that human nature dictates that humans 'will glorify themselves or attempt to...' please, do share it.  You are quite correct that there is precious little PHYSICAL evidence to prove the reality of God. I do think there is evidence to suggest it. Suggestion is just that, suggestion. It does not require a preponderance of the evidence at all.  You misquote me here. I said that there is NO physical evidence... not 'precious little.' Any evidence that exists can only suggest that God exists if there is a pre-disposition to believe that God exists. If you are asserting that the evidence, by itself, can suggest that God exists, then share with me the evidence of which you speak.  I do think there is plenty of reason to believe in God. In reality, there are no 'reasons' to believe in God. Any 'reason' that you have for believing in God is made up in your mind. I believe in God. Why? Because I believe in God. I could list many reasons why I decide to believe in God, but they would simply be reasons to justify my belief. I do not need to justify my belief. I believe because I believe. Share with me what reasons you have for believing in God, and you will begin to see that your 'reasons' are fabricated by you.
...so I guess I'll just stop now. Thank you! Whew... :p   In theory, there has to be one immortal Creator of superior intelligence. I could go into it, but I'll spare you the details. There HAS to be? Hmm... I don't think so. Why don't you go into it and spare us no details.  ...why Christianity is the One True Way and there is no other religion... You believe that Christianity is the 'One True Way.' And if it is... then it is. But your belief does not make it so. You believe Christianity is the one true way to live with God forever in heaven. However, this belief has underlying assumptions which are also beliefs, one of which is the assumption that God even exists. And if God exists, that God is like the God described in the Bible.  These are things that can only be accepted through faith. It is not possible to KNOW these things... only to BELIEVE.
This statement is wrong... Thats proof for me that Jesus existed and that he is God...  Your penultimate sentence sums this up well with the emphasis that I added. What you describe is sufficient 'proof' for you to believe. Why? Because you believe. Other than the Bible (which is far from being an accurate historical textbook) from where do you obtain the evidence of these prophets and their prophecies?   I am not discussing the God/Person of Jesus specifically. I am not discussing whether or not Jesus is the Son of God, who rose from the dead in atonement for our sins and the sins of the whole world. (Which, incidentally, I believe.) I am discussing the God of the Hebrews (or any other god for that matter). To believe the prophesies of which you speak, one must have faith. To believe that Jesus actually rose from the dead and ascended into heaven, one must have faith. There is no physical evidence that I am aware of to indicate that it did happen the way the Bible said it happened... except for in writings of human beings allegedly inspired by God. It takes faith to believe that those human beings were inspired by God. It takes faith to believe that what they describe actually happened the way they describe it.  What I can say with certainty that cannot be disputed as far as I'm aware, is that whatever happened... happened. If a woman named Mary was impregnated by the Holy Spirit and conceived a child that she named Jesus who was crucified, died and buried, only to come back to life three days later and ascend into heaven after 40 days... then that's what happened. I believe that's what happened, but there's no physical evidence to prove that's actually what happened. It takes faith to believe.  And these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000-2500 approx years! Define "unchanged."
Something that made everything else. I like to call him "God." Along these lines, then... who or what 'made' God? Your answer will likely be that God wasn't made, but always has existed, right? If God has always existed, why couldn't that 'speck of dust' always have existed?
Thiest: I believe in God?  What is God as best defined by you?  Describe the nature of God. What is it that you believe in? If a God exists, then God is as God is.
Do you believe that you will hear an understanding of God that you've not heard before, or are you of the belief you are open-minded on the subject, and might well have an epiphany?  What possible concern is any of that to you?  Some actually search for knowledge through debate. This is a debate forum if you recall. Don't play if you're not so inclined but to post warnings not to fall in this trap, c'mon.
True but this progesses nothing twoards a conversation because you have no told me the nature of such an existance.  You have said if A is then A=A.... thats saying a lot without saying anything at all because you have failed to provide what A is. I am suggesting that (assuming a God exists) the nature of God is unknowable in the realm in which we exist. Unlike a square or a rock or a chair or a tree which are of this physical realm, and for which we can make a definition and then test the object to determine if it fits the definition, we cannot do this with God, simply because there is no way to 'test' God within the physical realm in which we exist. Many different people have many different ideas, none of which have evidence independent of their interpretations. These individual interpretations have no bearing on the true nature of God (again assuming a God exists). It is possible that some of these individual interpretations coincide with some aspect of the true nature of God. It is also possible that no individual interpretation comes close to defining the true nature of God. Ultimately, it is unknowable in the physical realm in which we exist.  By asking the question that you are asking, you may get responses from individuals with their personal interpretations of the God as they see God. None of these will have any 'proof.' I recognize that regardless of what anyone believes, God is as God is (assuming a God exists).  Certainly, discussion beyond what I pose is possible, but ultimately doesn't get us any closer to knowing the true nature of God, nor does it get us any closer to determining whether or not a God exists. That is the realm of belief. There are a multitude of beliefs about the nature of God (including a belief in the non-existence of God). What I stated is one thing that can be said of God with certainty.
Well then this is applicable to your response: ... T:I believe in God A:What is God? T:I dont know. Ultimately, this is the way anybody would have to answer. The conversation could follow thusly: T:I don't know what God is. But I do know what I believe God to be. I believe God to be X, Y, and Z. Instead of making up X, Y, and Z, I recognize that making up X, Y, and Z is irrelevant to the question of 'What is God.'   Then my question to you would be that if you dont know what God is... then what is it that you believe in? And my answer is that I believe God is as God is, however God is, assuming a God exists. That is my answer. That is what I believe. Anything beyond that is speculation, and I have no need to speculate.  I mean no offense but you have stated nothing relevant. If I am asking of what A is and you say A=A, that is nothing new and I learn nothing about A but rather that A is A which is self evident.  I have stated my answer to your question. You did not ask me to teach you anything about 'A.' Rather you asked, "What is God as best defined by you? Describe the nature of God. What is it that you believe in?" I have answered your question. I cannot change that you are not satisfied with my answer.  I'm curious to know how you would answer your own question? How would you define God? How would you describe the nature of God? What do you believe?
Within the context of this discussion, I have not indicated that I 'believe in' a God. Regarding your 'unie' example, the same point applies:  If a unie exists, then a unie is as a unie is.  Without a clear definition of a unie, we cannot know for certain whether or not a unie exists. The same applies to God. And since a clear and ultimate definition of God is unattainable in this realm, then we cannot know with certainty whether or not a God exists. We can only believe. If we believe that a God exists, we may also assign attributes to this God that we believe this God possesses.  All right then under this technically I re-pose my question: Teach me about God.  Not I, nor anyone in this physical realm, can teach you about God as God is, assuming God exists. I, along with everyone else, could only teach you what may or may not be true about God according to some perception of God (and again, assuming God exists).  My question can be taken both ways.  By saying "What is God" and "What do you believe God to be" I am essentially attempting to ask the same thing. I understand this now. It was not clear to me initially, as there is a distinction between the two question. One asks what IS, as in reality. The other asks what do you BELIEVE is.
...and mankind is by nature discontented. This is a belief. Based on the lens through which you view humanity. It is certainly not a universal belief, and therefore, not an all-encompassing statement.
This is a belief. Based on the lens through which you view humanity. It is certainly not a universal belief, and therefore, not an all-encompassing statement.   But who chooses who's belief is not relevant enough?  With all the beliefs in the world today that 1 man alone may be right, and all the other millions sucking to another belief may be wrong.
Well, the simplest refutation would be to say that God is omnipotent within the realms of logic. Everything that isn't inherently contradictory, God could do.  Another simple refutation would be to say that since God is beyond the physical realm, the logic of the physical realm doesn't apply to him. Perhaps he can create a rock so heavy he can't lift it, and yet still lift it. Our logic may simply not apply, the same way that Euclidean geometry doesn't apply in cruved space.
The first refutation is not a refutation at all - it is a retreat.   Fair enough.   The second refutation sounds like something Rousseau said, along the lines of "I don't care about logic. I'll believe in God privately." If one can claim that the power of God is beyond logic, but still true, then one can also claim that the powerlessness of God is beyond logic, but true. Similarily, I can claim that "2+2=5" is true by saying "We humans are too simple-minded to understand it, therefore it must be true." That's fallacious.  You missed my point. Logic is simply a set of rules, which works for us here. There is no reason to believe that logic would work outside of this universe, however. It's not a matter of whether or not we can comprehend anything, it's just a matter of whether or not the same rules govern where God is. There's no way for us to know that they do, so it's quite possible that logic doesn't work there.
 God can do whatever He wants. Although one can say "God does not" or "God is not", a thiest believeing in and worshipping the God of Abraham and Joachim I do not think should ever say "God can not" anything....  With God, all things and everything is possible.   Sentiments such as those expressed above in my view seem to be evident in Western Christianity where it seems believers are too often trying to bring God down to our level, imposing limits etc. If it is not possible to comprehend God... then why do people even try?
I think your assertion that the proof is fallacious is a result of the fact that you're attacking the wrong proof.  To restate the proof in premise/conclusion form, it would look like this.  Premise #1: - If God is all powerful, then he can do this (the rock thing.) Premise #2: - This is impossible due to the Law of Non-Contradiction. Conclusion: - God is not all-powerful.  It is based on a completely valid logical method:  Premise #1: - If P, then Q Premise #2: - Q is false Conclusion: - P is false  This is all pure speculation and an excercise in futility. What could we possibly discover about God when any theory concerning his capabilities cannot be tested? It's interesting that this question even comes up but I think it's fairly obvious that this question was designed as a trap because regardless of the answer, the conclusion one is supposed to draw is that God is not all powerful.
Christians, please clear you minds All of you commit the mistake of "incorrect classification" about the  "God and Stone" question  You put a completely logical thing into the illogical category You confound things like "a square circle" with "making a stone that one cannot pick up"  the former is certainly illogical, but the latter is not, workers who build viaducts have to make big concrete stone that they cannot lift by their hands. It 's absolutely possible in real world, and if it's possible in real world, how can it be impossible in the realm  of logic? Please don't shy away from the "God and Stone" question by instictively saying that "God cannot do illogical things" just because the question challenge your unoffendable icon .
God has already made a rock so big that nobody can move it.  It's called Ayer's Rock, in the center of Australia.  Then there's also Stone Mountain in Georgia, the largest monolithic piece of exposed granite in the world.  :)  so , can god make a stone he can't lift? I don't bother to doubt the truthfulness of your "evidence" (tell me how you know it is God who creates Ayer's Rock) I just want you to stick to this question
It doesn't matter. I suppose if He wanted to, He could do it, then undo it.  I believe it's already been shown in this thread that there are things that God can't do.  So what? There's still nothing more powerful!  So you admit that god is not omnipotent? if so,well, the foundation of Christianity is tottering.
the question was originally about an unbreakable rock. an unbreakable solid cannot exist, no matter how hard it is. hardness is relative, not absolute, therefore something cannot be infinitely hard. not only that, but all solids (rocks included) are made up of particles. even if the particles are extremely well bonded, they can possibly separate. the strengh of particle bonding is also relative  in the case of a rock so big God cannot lift it, the only concievable rock of that nature is a rock of infinite volume and mass. such a rock would use up all the space in the universe. since moving something means taking it from one place and putting it in another place, there would be no place that this rock would not be, and therefore no place to move the rock to. in such a case, we can say yes, God wouldn't be able to move this rock. if we want to be technical, then if God is powerful enough to create a rock of infinite volume and mass, then thats pretty dam powerful. even if he can't move such a rock, it would only be because its illogical to move a rock that takes up infinite space, not because God's ability is limited  a man insists that God is omnipotent  God is so powerful that he creates the world,a universe of which no man can see the boundary, everything in the universe comes from him. when asked whether god can make a stone he cannot lift, he says god's power is not limited even if he cannot create that stone because "the rock takes up infinite space" So a god who creates an infinite universe from nothingness cannot creates an infinite stone. the man who makes this kind of "argument" is either shameless, or mindless  again, the crux is: can he lift this stone?   P.S. this man also has a misconception about logic  moving a big object in insufficient space is "impracticable", not "illogical" we are sometimes met by problems like moving a new sofa into our home but the door is too small, will you say this act is illogical?
I admit nothing of the sort. God is omnipotent- ALMIGHTY, having virtually  unlimited authority or influence. (Webster's)  I doubt the foundation of Christianity depends at all on what I think. :p  you just give me irrelevant, useless, definition from the dictionary you are still unable to refute my words with reasons Remember, you say that there are somethings god can't do, and you say, "SO WHAT?"
Irrelevancy is in the eye of the beholder.  When using the Engish language, one usually refers to English definitions of words. I don't know which of your words need refuting. The argument presented is meaningless. You are merely trying to say that God is not infinitely powerful because here is an illogical thing that He cannot do. I and others have already admitted that there are things that God cannot or will not ever do. (He won't send another flood. He won't lie to us. He won't deny a believer entry into Heaven., etc)  Whether the rock can be made or not is totally inconsequential to the belief that God is omnipotent.  If you don't want to use the accepted definitions of words, you have no business arguing with people who do.  haha, another shameless man here. you distort, or purposely deny, the things in my first post. I clearly explained that "making a stone one cannot lift" is an logical act and you distort it, you say I challenge god's omnipotence with an illogical thing. I don't want you to quote the definition not because I don't accept them, but because I know already, and I am challenging the validity of the concept about "omnipotence".(Who,in this forum, don't know the definition of "omnipotent?)
Yes, but can he make a rock that is not completely unbreakable, yet too hard for him to break it?  Rather than joust with linguistics, why don't we simply ask the root question?  Can God violate the rules of logic? Can God do the logicaly impossible?  That's the real question here.
Theists cannot say no, or they would be suggesting that logic is more powerful than God.  Why should that be a problem? Why should an inability to do the logically impossible be considered some sort of flaw? It's not like logic is an actual force wrestling with God to see which is better. Any theists out there have any comments? Personally, defining onmipotence as being able to do anything that's logically possible, instead of just anything doesn't seem like that big a deal.
i said that an all-powerful God CAN create a stone of infinite size and mass do not shun the words "he cannot lift" you have said that god cannot lift a stone of infinite size and mass  therefore the whole sentence should be  "An all-powerful god can create a stone of infinite size and mass that he cannot lift." And it's apparently self-defeating.  to move something means to take it from a place it is to a place it is not. if the stone is infinitely large that it takes up thin entire universe, then there is nowhere that this stone is not, and therefore nowhere it can be moved to   moving a big sofa through a small door is possible if you break the doorway wider or you break the sofa down smaller. it is "impractical" if it doesnt seem worth the work just to get the sofa in the room. if getting the sofa in the room is worth the effort, then breaking it apart or knocking the wall out becomes practical. practical is relative  in the case of moving a solid object of volume X in a space of volume X, that is illogical. the only way something can move can move to, then it simply cannot be moved. get it?  again you words slap back on your face why doesn't god expand the universe so that the stone can be moved freely? like widening the doorway?  once he can't lift the stone, he is not omnipotent!
Why should that be a problem? Why should an inability to do the logically impossible be considered some sort of flaw?   making a stone that one cannot lift is not illogical!
...it doesnt require faith to believe a mixture of acid and alkaline will produce a salt, or that a ball will accelerate downward if you drop it. action-consequence relations will remain true regardless. these are PROVEN Tsk, tsk... There are typically exceptions. And this is no exception. Just because you drop a ball does not mean it will accelerate downward. There are many ways in which other forces could be acting on the ball. And gravity, apparently, isn't as straight-forward as it first seems. How about the mixture of acid and alkaline in an environment of various gases other than the usual...  To be a little more precise, we could accurately say this: assuming constant factors in a controlled environment without unusual circumstances or changes, we can assume that a ball dropped will accelerate downward or that mixing acid and alkaline will produce a salt (because our experience tells us to expect this). However, if any of the parameters change, this may not happen.  We can say something similar with the Superbowl example... Assuming constant factors without unusual circumstances, etc., we can assume the Superbowl will happen as planned.  There remains the possibility in both cases for exceptions to the rule.  The perspective from which you are debating this topic depends largely on semantics. You can continue to debate from that position, but in order to do so, I believe it would be helpful to agree upon the definitions of the words you are using. Otherwise, it could go back and forth forever. It is evident that you are not using the same definitions as Kronus, Mach, and Dzeron.
a ball wil ALWAYS accelerate downward when dropped.  Nope.  Consider: You could 'drop' a metal ball in the presence of a powerful magnet. The ball will not accelerate downward, but rather will travel toward the magnet -- even if the magnet is directly above the 'dropped' ball.
wait, you changed the color but you didn't change the font size!!   Get with the program if you are going to cut and paste other's ideas!! :)

If you told me you caught a 5lb. trout in your swimming pool yesterday and it was delicious I might look long and hard into your pool for a long time. That doesn't mean I really expect to see fish.To look long and hard for a long time sounds like fun to me. emoticon_xangel
Please consult your doctor if it persists for more than 4 hours.No way! I'm callin' ALL my girlfriends!  ..to tell 'em ,"The trout is out!"

Guy: "Tell ya what... you think about me long and hard for awhile, and then make your decision."  Ba-doom-chink! Yes, thank you very much... I'm here all night, folks! :p
The atheist position is more toward what you are calling agnostic...there is no absolute proof that any God does not exist, but we are happy to use the day to day meaning of reality and put it in the box with the 'we are all parts of a big purple duck'. Agnostism is not ready to accept that god does not exist but not ready to worship either - your version of agnostism is a little open (beleiving that everything could be true) compared to the general concept, or at least taking it to the extremes that atheism is (rather than taking the lack of god on faith its more 'assuming this world exists as it appears to then there is no God').  If you are with the Space alien people, then you're atheist - if you actually think that there is a meaningful, reasonable chance that God might exist but are not sure you are agnostic.
So we have, in order of humility:  Agnosticism: Don't know, can't know. But I have my opinion. Note: Many religious people and humanists alike fit into this category.   Theism: Probably can't know, but doesn't realize it. My "heart/soul/essence/whatever" tells me it is truth. Note: Often impossible to reason with. No scientifically measurable way to prove position.  Atheism: Can't know, but thinks and says otherwise. Note: Usually angry. No scientifically measurable way to prove position.You have done a marvelous job knocking down strawmen of your own construction. Having offered a naive and superficial caricature of atheism, agnosticism, and theism, you then imagine a self-serving hierarchy that is, in a word, worthless - all in a silly effort to show yourself most humble. Ironic.
www.dictionary.com What sophistry - perhaps we should drop the university philosophy courses and simply pass out pocket dictionaries. emoticon_rolleyes Oh well, see for example The Atheism Web.   In fact, epistemology is not the same as ontology, and agnosticism and atheism address different domains.

Agnosticism and atheism obviously address the same domain. (if they can be said to "address domains" at all). Atheism concerns the existence of God, as does agnosticism, ...Belief and knowledge are not the same thing. There are, in fact, fully agnostic theists (fideism, daoism, many forms of deism, and some forms of buddhism) whose theism is grounded in faith alone. Conversely, it is perfectly consistent for an atheist, grounding her stance in the pervasive successes of methodological naturalism, to acknowledge the inherent unknowability of any purported supernatural realm. So, for example ... In contrasting the Western religions with science, the most important criterion of distinction is that the supernatural or spiritual realm is unknowable ... Given this fiat by the theistic believers, science simply ignores the supernatural as being outside the scope of scientific inquiry. Scientists in effect are saying:You religious believers set up your postulates as truths, and we take you at your word. By definition, you render your beliefs unassailable and unavailable.This attitude is not one of surrender, but simply an expression of the logical impossibility of proving the existence of something about which nothing can possibly be known through scientific investigation.   - Understanding Science: An Introduction to Concepts and Issues by Arthur N. Strahler A thoroughly agnostic atheism is not only coherent but, I would argue, thoroughly sound. Theism: Probably can't know, but doesn't realize it. My "heart/soul/essence/whatever" tells me it is truth. Note: Often impossible to reason with. No scientifically measurable way to prove position.Citing the basic literal definition of words to argue a position concerning the definition of words is almost the exact opposite of sophistry.Perhaps you will post your source for this "basic literal definition" of 'theism'. I suggest that it's little more than petty ad hominem.
In my opinion, nobody has any surefire way of knowing whether or not there is a God. At least theists have the "feeling" thing. (although people of all religions get variations of this feeling, as do cult members, and many psychotics)  So we have, in order of humility:  Agnosticism: Don't know, can't know. But I have my opinion. Note: Many religious people and humanists alike fit into this category.   Theism: Probably can't know, but doesn't realize it. My "heart/soul/essence/whatever" tells me it is truth. Note: Often impossible to reason with. No scientifically measurable way to prove position.  Atheism: Can't know, but thinks and says otherwise. Note: Usually angry. No scientifically measurable way to prove position. why even mention science? nothing concerning one's belief or lack of in God is in any way scientifically measureable. by (popular) definition, science is meaningless where faith is concerned. there is nothing about a faith-based belief that science can verify, particularly since verifying the belief with evidence makes the belief no longer faith-based. "without faith it is impossible to please God." the search for evidence is both pointless and unhealthy for bible-based theists
Can you define meaningful in a universal context? Of course you can't. It's very obviously an entirely subjective idea.  I suppose it can be said, by your definition, that I am effectively an atheist.   Since I can't see any clear line between theism and the purple duck theory and a magical super-being creating the Universe a few thousand years ago, I'll use your scale. Have you one? So far, it seems arbitrary, unless you judge the possibility of such theories holding water by employing democracy (unwise, I think).  The arbitary scale is indeed arbitary but without such a scale everything is meaningless as you end up believing and seeing everything. All it is is just assuming that the universe you live in is real and that things are causing the effects you see.  By meaningful I mean that you beleive it could have an effect on your life (or afterlife).
Given that you're a newbie, I'll offer you a bit of advice: learn to discuss. If you take issue with someone's assertion, feel free to dismantle it. ad hominem attacks impress no one.They impress me actually. trs summed up what was wrong with the OP succinctly with just the right amount of personal attack IMO.
I did not say that atheists were not caring people. I was just trying to show ...  ... Atheists constantly mock, belittle, and ridicule theists and their God as if that validates their nonbelief and is perfectable acceptable to be vile towards other people.This is often called: 'talking out of both sides of your mouth'
Kaill,  Perhaps you could consider that you have a misconception of what atheism actually is. An atheist is literally only a non-thiest.  The prefix "a" means without, thus atheism is without theistic belief.  All agnostics actually technically fall into the category of atheists. There are weak atheists and strong atheists.  Agnostics would fall under the weak atheist category in that they do not profess certain knowledge or belief one way or the other. They only know that they do not believe.  Strong atheists deny the existance of God completely through various arguments and often deny even such a possibility.
The reality is that the default is atheism. You are born an atheist, an ignorant, atheist. One has to receive information about religious mythology in order to start forming a belief about it.  -Mach  Nugget of wisdom alert. emoticon_idea emoticon_xhoho
If you don't have a problem with God always existing, why do you have a problem with our universe always existing (even before the big bang, the universe still existed. It was just a immensly dense neutron star, which favored the big band, which in turn made the neutron star into something more similar to what we see today)?  If you think it's fair to ask, "What's before the Big Bang?" I think it's only fair I get to ask, "What's before God?" Um, I don't know where you got this "neutron star" business for the BB.   It was the universe, not one star.
I believe you mean "Hawking".
please dont tell me jimmyjacks got banned too....  What was he banned for?
That would be futile, I would just get another ISP, and I would use my IP disuse programmes to get back at you, you can't escape free speech these days.  "Free speech" is not the issue. We are all guests here and we are expected to abide by forum rules. No one has a "right" to post here. If, in fact, you've been banned from this forum, the decent and honourable thing to do would be for you to quit posting here. To continue to post here after you've been banned serves only to discredit you.
The bold quotes of yours flow directly after one another, and are completely contradictory.  God didn't need to start.  Everything needs to start from something.That isn't actually what he said. He rejected the idea that something could start from nothing, not that something could be without a beginning.  Obviously it can't be taken to support a Christian God, but the belief in the need for some sort of creator to explain existence isn't that easily rejected.  Duo: you're accusation of 'special pleading' for God isn't really fair, as God is by definition not of the same nature as normal existing objects. God is seen as being beginingless in that he transcends time. If the universe has 'no beginning' in the more literal sense then we run into the problem that this means an infinite amount of time has passed, which is impossible.   Personally, I think that trying to work out the roots of existence from rules within existence is more than likely impossible. There are 'scientific' speculations and 'religious' speculations, but I've never seen anything definitive from either side.
the problem then is, how could the universe begin in the midst of absolutely nothing (no time, no matter, no space, no energy)? what could possibly trigger the universe's beginning? (and then of course, where did these triggering events come from?)  you will end up at negative infinity at some pointI think the currently popular belief is that time itself is limited. Space, time, energy, matter and laws all came into existence together. Of course that's impossible for us to envisage....
obviously. in fact, it sounds like the ultimate cop out. it doesnt even sound like a theory Well it isn't really in the scientific sense as far as I can make out.  Science works (very well) within the grounds of cause and effect and empirical data. So this is outside of science's remit.
Hmmm, God, if there is a God. . . .
Wait! Wait! What is this about the physics of water?  If you fill a container 3/4 full of water and freeze it, the water, of course, expands in freezing--one of the weird faculties of water, but its weight increases?  I'm sorry it's early in the morning and I'm only half-functioning but where can I find out more about the weird and wonderful physics of water?
Reminds me of an old riddle. What weighs more? A pound of lead or a pound of feathers?
OK, Kronus, indulge me. I confess I have an unholy fascination with the physics of water.  Has anyone ever explained why water expands when it becomes a solid, rather than becoming denser, as is the normal case (or so I believe) in physics? What is it about the combo of hydrogen and oxygen in this case that yields a rather unruly entity?
Kronus, thank you for your very patient explanation.  Can one then infer that in all (or, at least, most cases) crystallization results in creating great spaces between molecules?  Sorry to ask some really stupid questions but I am not very well educated in physics. If it happens to be true, space between molecules increases when crystallization occurs, it give me an interesting take on the way the universe is put together. I recommend boning up on string theory, too, because I'll dream up some half-a$$ed theory about crystallization playing a part in strings of molecules or atoms or whatever comprises string theory and--what about the protein spiral (I guess this applies specifically to the DNA molecule)?  And, I guess I should see if there is a science section and if they answer stupid low-level questions like mine.
Kronus, I've gone into Science and asked my stupid questions, but if they bash me for being stupid and are really mean, I'll be back in here to whine.
How about because while many charities have a Christian foundation, not all their contributors or workers will be Christian? Exhibit A: the American Red Cross.
From another thread:   The head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency is directing people wanting to contribute to give to the Christian charities above. Again, where are the atheist organizations?  Well, who was the head of FEMA appointed by? A brief googling seems to suggest a Mr. G.W. Bush was responsible, it wouldn't be entirely out of the question for dubya to appoint another member of the Christian right to this permission, who might be keen for Christian charities to be promoted. Other possible reasons are that religion is very strong in the south, and hence religious charities are more likely to have resources in the south, were the problem is.  In any case, the red cross is by far the largest organisation involved, and as has already been estalbished is secular. And as I said before just because the organisations are Christian doesn't necessarily mean that their workers or contributors are.
As you stated above, the majority would be Christians. I can't think of too many philantropic atheists, can you?    Why is it such an issue ?  To me if an organisation is doing some good it doesn't matter if they are Muslim, Hindu, Christian etc.
is it because chritsians beleive in charity and help to the less fortunate? Is that the right answer?
It's as simple as this.  Most charities need organization. Most religious organizations are organized. Most religious organizations are non-profit.  SO most charities are based on or around non-profit organizations, most of which are religious organizations, most of which, in the US, are christian.  But there are Jewish, Muslim, etc. charities, just fewer of them, since there are fewer Jews, Muslims, etc.  It's very simple and it's nothing special to do with Christianity.  Why are most charities in the Middle East Muslim? Because Christians aren't charitable. Make sense?
As you stated above, the majority would be Christians. I can't think of too many philantropic atheists, can you? emoticon_rolleyes   Just one I can think of of the top of my head.  Bill Gates Foundation  Maybe Gates isn't athiest, but he's not Christian.  http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Believer's%20Corner/meet_a_few_atheists.htm

Is there a better way to phrase it so you don't go off spitting out invectives yourself? Maybe, "Joe, you know tens of thousands of gay men are dying of AIDS due to homosexual sex. And still a great many of them fail to use condoms even after they've been counseled."   It's really hard getting through to you folks, brummer. How many gay deaths is it going to take before gays start recognizing it's not godly religious beliefs that destroy lives, but the abrogation of those beliefs, including supporting gay sex. Ugh! You don't get it! AIDS is not caused by gay sex. It is what happens after one is infected with HIV. More and more these days the gay community is aware of the risks, and more guys are being careful.  Here, try this out for size. "Tens of thousands of straight men and women are dying of AIDS due to heterosexual sex. And still a great many fail to use condoms after they've been counseled." "It's really hard getting through to you folks, EZ. How many heterosexual deaths is it going to take before hets start recognizing it's not godly religious beliefs that destroy lives, but the abrogation of those beliefs, including supporting heterosexual sex?"
Nooo, I think we should conduct a pole, as cell death would call it, to determine whether or not joe brummer thinks too much. We can't leave it for just monster to decide.
there is once word to tell my opinion.....shutup.
 I know an atheist who is far more logical than anyone else I've heard to date.  Well, one can't be truly logical and not be an atheist (or at least agnostic.) As any religion simply flys in the face of logic. Faith and logic are poles apart.  Keep truckin' Jim! Happy weekend to you bro.
Nice try. But that don't fly. Whereas, athiest do approach death as being much like the same manner of existence as before you were born, I don't think any of them think that gives them the licence to rape, kill, murder or be the next Hitler. The idea that judeo/christian believers have the copyrights to moral living and obediance to societies laws, is a pure and arrogant fallacy.  I am no atheist by any sense of the word, but neither am I a pious or religious person. Fortunantly, I do not require being mandated by some religious law not to kill or steal or whatever. I have common sense and I use it. I suggest to you that if a body of people were on a deserted island with no contact with the outside world or any exposure to any religion whatsoever, they too, would know right from wrong.  Is it your position that if it weren't for religious laws mandating you from stealing and killing, that you would go out and do it? If so, for the sake of everyone, stick with Jesus or Allah, or whatever crutch it is, that is keeping you from going berserk. It could be the tooth fairy. I don't care. Just don't shoot me!  As they say, "Whatever get's you through the night. Is alright."
The two long-winded statements above basically say most people reason qualitatively but not quantitatively, and sometimes not even well qualitatively. It is an unfortunate side-effect of an ineffective educational system, no doubt.

Based on the definitions you gave, they're quite different. Atheism is a matter of personal belief, secularism is a matter of public policy. There's no reason you can't be devoutly religious and a secularist. You would have your religious views, but believe that public policy should not be based on them.
 A devoutly religious person would disagree with all the statements in the Humanist Manifesto that I highlighted. Would they believe that public policy should be based on things that they don't believe?  Yes. I know of no one who agrees with all government policies, or all of the premesis that they're based on. But we do all agree (or at least almost all) that we need some method for forming those policies. Compromises must be made. A religious secularist could believe, for example, that if we allow religious beliefs to dictate policy than it's just a matter of time before general religious freedom is compromised for all but those who follow the religion of the ruling party. Rather than risk that they would think it an acceptable compromise to have some policies that they don't agree with, as long as they don't actively compromise their faith.    A hypothetical - If a public policy was a vote on abortion, and the "devoutly religious" person voted no, and the atheist voted yes, would the secularist, or humanist, be a non vote, a neutral position? There is no neutral position, because the issue would be decided one way or the other, and would effect the society of the secularist the same as it would the other two. It's clear who the secularist would side with. It's not clear to me at all. They might think that the heart of the issue is whether a fetus is a person, and so be fine with 1st trimester abortions, but not 2nd or 3rd. Or they may decide that viability is the issue, and so be fine with abortions late into the 2nd trimester. Or they may think that the potential for life is enough to warrant protection, and so oppose all abortions. It's a complex enough issue that even if you remove "God says" from the debate, the answer isn't obvious.  The point here is that while a secularist believes that "God says" is inadeuqate justification for forming policy, it doesn't mean that those who say "God says" are necessarily wrong. The religious person says "God commands that you do not steal." The atheist and the secularist agree with the not stealing, just for different reasons.
Reaching the unbelievers with the Gospel is responsible, according to God's command in Matthew 28:18-19. And there's nothing bigoted about it.  For your consideration, EZ...  Many Paths  As men approach me, so I receive them. All paths, Arjuna, lead to me. -- Hinduism, Bhagavad Gita 4.11  My Lord, you are one although variously appearing. -- Jainism, Hemachandra   We believe in God, and what has been revealed to us, and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in what was given to Moses, Jesus, and the Prophets from their land. We make no distinction between any of them, and to God do we submit. -- Islam, Qur'an 3.84  There are righteous men among the nations who have a share in the world to come. -- Judaism, Tosefta Sanhedrin  And Peter opened his mouth and said, "Truly I believe that God shows no partiality, but in every nation any one who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. -- Christianity, Acts 10:34-35  Just as the sin-offering atones for Israel, so righteousness atones for the peoples of the world. -- Judaism, Talmud  Tolerance  To be attached to a certain view and to look down upon other views as inferior - this the wise men call a fetter. -- Buddhism, Sutta Nipata  Like the bee, gathering honey from different flowers, the wise man accepts the essence of different scriptures and sees only the good in all religions. -- Hinduism, Srimad Bhagavatam  A man has a faith. If he says "This is my faith", so far he maintains truth. But by that he cannot proceed to the absolute conclusion: "This alone is truth and everything else is false". -- Buddhism, Majjhima Nikaya

IF God really exists what must he/she/it be like? George Burns :)
I like your thinking, although I disagree with it. You say that God is the universe. I propose that God is relational. That without a relational god we are truly hopeless. The problem you are running into is that you are trying to imagine god existing within the framework of creation (universe etc.) and tying his existence to that. NOw I am going to say something that will really not make sense to you. God existed BEFORE time. Chew on that one a bit. Eternality implies an existence outside of time. And in fact, much of science alludes to this possibility. I certainly could never prove it and do not propose to but would like it if you would consider the implications.  As for God communicating to us, there is nothing that prevents that. Especially if you accept the idea that we are imago dei, image bearers of the divine. We are not perfect images but we are rational, emotional, spiritual, beings  EF Can you explain spiritual beings?  I honestly don't know what that means.
It's not the substance of my argument but its spirit that counts.emoticon_xangel   Guffaw.  IF God really exists what must he/she/it be like?   I'm sure God has a huge sense of humor.
As for the rest of you I have a bet.  If I can't guess your weight (lets say to with in an ounce) I will publicly apologize to every religious person I have ever insulted in the forum.  Any takers?  Go ahead, I bet you'll never guess.  I don't recall you ever insulting anyone, however.
Perhaps it was in another life...  Your weight is zero.  Your weight immediately before your death will be the same as it is immediately after, but YOU will no longer be there.  You are weightless.  That's exactly correct! How did you know? I used to weigh a few milligrams more, but I have been watching my weight. Now I'm down to a very svelte zero - can't wait to sport those Speedos this summer!  I guess you don't need to make any public apologies now.
Anyone else got more than a trite one-liner on their idea of God (or whatever you think he/she/it is)?  Actually, my idea of "god" is eerily similar to yours.  The entire natural world around me, aka the universe, is to my mind "god". Everything around us, and everything that we are, comes from this physical world, and the complexity and beauty of it are never less than astounding.  You pose some intersting ideas here. Given all of it, then the question I run into, is "what is my purpose". The idea that I am simply an accidental collection of particles provides meaninglessness to life and thereby leads to hopelessness. To state that there is a purpose to life implies that there is something that exists beyond myself that gives purpose.  I will never understand this line of thinking. Concluding that life is meaningless and hopeless because it is not created or guided by a supernatural being is completely illogical to my mind. IMHO, "what is my purpose?" is a false question.   Firstly, why does one's life require a purpose? Cannot simply living and enjoying every moment of being alive be reason enough? Do you live your life for an end goal (God), or for the enjoyment of living and the people and the world around you? To reword the old saying, is life about the destination, or the journey?  Secondly, why does life being "random particles" prevent a person from having a purpose? Your purpose is whatever you would like it to be. Ultimately, our purpose is to perpetuate life and the species, hopefully making the natural world in which we live a better place along the way.  Why does "random particles" make life meaningless? Given Liminus', and my, interpretation of "god", we as humans are part of an amazing natural world, a random (semi-random) mix of particles that have come together to give us life and the gift of the world around us. That's not meaningless, it's incredible. We're part of an unimaginably old and incredibly complex chain of reactions, and those reactions of which we were briefly a part of, will continue to go on for eons. You and I are part of that natural world.   IMHO, if you believe life is meaningless and hopeless, it is a conscious choice, and the problem lies within you, not in the need for a supernatural God. There's a world around you full of hope, and full of the need to have people contribute to it, you only have to choose to do so, for your own sake. No outside motivation should be required.  Waxy
I think the point I was trying to make is that all humans long to be a part of something greater than themselves. It is what I was trying to communicate with why we tell stories. Why do some aspire to greater things than others? Why do we even contemplate the spiritual at all. Why are we emotional, why do we need love, why do we need other people. There are many many questions that compose the purpose question.  Simple answer - because we have evolved a conscious mind that greatly increases our chance of survival.   Many of the qualities you list are not unique to humans, they are common in the natural world. Why do wolves travel in packs? Why so some wolves aspire to be the alpha male, while others are content with subservient roles?   Emotions, love, the need for others, even the spiritual, are all evolved conscious mechanisms by which humans greatly increase their strength and chance of survival as a species. I don't view them as being separate or distinct from simple functions like eating and sleeping.   Te purpose of all of these things is simple, to survive and perpetuate the species.  Even you cannot get away from it. You say you don't need a God but you still indicate that purpose comes from inside yourself, your choice, you admit the need for purpose.  I don't admit the need for a purpose, especially an "ultimate" or "universal" purpose. Living to enjoy life is all that's required. Enjoying life often means having some goals, a job, your family, etc... If that is what you consider a "purpose", then I guess I would agree that we often need a puprose.  Purpose is an abstract human construct, it's certainly not required to live.   Why does it need to be external is your real question. I submit, that the idea that we live 80 years within this current cosmic reality and that everything then just stops, lends itself to a lack of purpose.  Perhaps it is. On an individual level moreso than on a large scale or species level. I question the need for an individual to look beyond themselves and the world around them to provide meaning to their lives. Why is the supernatural better than the natural?  Why though? I laid out the ground work of why I believe your assertion is false, but you haven't provided any support for it.  Also you did not address the issue of depression. Check the statistics from NIMH and you will see that the number one and two reasons for it are a lack of purpose and lack of control. Control just adds to the debate. We don't need to control if we feel that our need for purpose is being met.  The APA has a great article on this. I was trying to paste the link but having a devil of a time with my computer. I will try to post again later.  I know very little about depression. I'm not one to sit around and feel sorry for myself. I've known very few people in my life that I would consider depressed, and those that are tend to annoy me, I have little time for them. The world is what you make it.  IMHO, depression is either a chemical imbalance, or is a conscious choice, a state of mind that can be overcome.  If people are depressed because they don't have a purpose, then they should simply look at the world around them and realize what they're missing, what they're a part of, and what they could be doing. Same thing goes for control, it's a matter of your chosen perception. If you don't feel you have control, step up and take control.  At any rate, I'm not sure what the point of the depression discussion is to be quite honest.   Waxy
Those are all good answers and distinct possibilities. However, they are as unprovable as my options. I think there is evidence to support your position. However, I would say there is evidence to support mine. The gist of the question is not whether or not god exists. But rather, IF he does then what must he be like. Speculate that God does exist and answer as if he does. Then what must he be like based on your experience.  EF  You lost me here EF.  I don't want to make assumptions, so perhaps you can clarify. I'm not sure what is unprovable on my part, and I'm not exactly clear on your position and what evidence there is to support it.  I'm disappointed that you didn't provide any evidence or support for your assertion that "the idea that we live 80 years within this current cosmic reality and that everything then just stops, lends itself to a lack of purpose."   I have speculated that "god" exists, it's everything around me, the natural world. Based on my experience the world can be profoundly beautiful and it can be very ugly. Ultimately, you and I are only minute pieces of the puzzle, a blink of the eye. It's up to us what we get out of life, and you get out what you put in.  Waxy
Terribly sorry for losing you and not responding with the appropriate analysis to support my statement on 80 years etc. Let me see if I can do better.  The part that is unprovable was:  Aspiration attributed to an animal is a stretch but not really what I want to argue.  I concur regarding giving humans thoughts and emotions to animals, but at some biological level, the desision is made regarding whether that animal will challenge for dominance or remain subservient. IMHO, that is not debatable, it's fact, observed repeatedly in nature and in captivity.  The evolution of a concious mind is not provable. One can assume evolution of a concious mind but to do so requires a leap of faith. It is not an observable phenomenon. It requires that you believe evolution occured. It also requires the assumption that there is not a "personal" God and the assumption that if God exists then He is completely uninvolved. There could be evidence to that degree, but there is evidence that God is involved. We could debate which evidence is better but it is debatable at best.  It requires that you accept the best (most supported) and least complicated possible answer to the question, evolution. I will agree that it can't be proven - given our current level of understanding.  The "assumption" that there is not in fact a personal "god" is not an assumption at all, it's a logical starting point.  Introducing a personal god and putting him in control is where assumptions begin and logic ends. It's a simple matter of Occam's Razor and the scientific method. Neither requires faith, only logic and intelligence (not meant as a insult, only in that one must be able to understand the science and logic in order for it to be of value).  There have been countless threads on this, and to my knowledge, there has not been any proof or evidence put forward as yet as to god's involvement. I'll leave that door open to you should you decide to attempt to supply it.   IMHO, there is no real debate here. The facts speak for themselves.  The idea you state of an impersonal universe and of evolution both support a beginning and and end to a single life. Evolution does not support life beyond death. It in fact contradicts it. Evolution comes from the assumption that things end. To better explain, assume that there is life after death, then how does that impact the "survival" idea. If all animals live beyond death then the need for individual survival falls off and even the need for societal survival falls away. It is not needed as a motivator as we will go on forever.  Survival as a motivator only allows me to do what is in my best interests. Even survival of a society only allows me to do what is best for my society and actually encourages warfare so that one society may dominate by being the fittest (so to speak). Knowing that we go on after death actually means that I don't have to work so hard at caring for myself and am instead free to care for others.  Does this make more sense?  Honestly? No. Not to me anyway.  I don't know many people who don't bother with trying to survive in this life because they believe in an afterlife where they will go on forever. I would fear for any person such as that's mental health.  Putting off today in favour of tomorrow will never make sense to me. Even if I had a second life, I'd prefer to live them one at a time, and each to its fullest.  I disagree with your assumptions regarding survival and warfare. Constant warring is not the means by which to best ensure our survival, it's an intentional misrepesentation often chosen to bolster the case for "god" over evolution.  As for having more time to care for others - If what you have left, your mark on the world, is what you leave behind, then caring for others and the world around you is of the utmost importance, but you have to survive in order to do so. Selfishness in not inherent in the need or desire to survive.  I'm not sure where else to go with this, IMHO, your premise is artificial. You also haven't really clarified why life is meaningless and hopeless without God, you've only presented the notion that you have more "free time" to worry about others if you have an afterlife in place. That may or may not be true, depending on the particular circumstances, but for the most part, I believe it's a false premise.  It would seem to me that our debate boils down to a very simple premise - the natural world around us vs. the supernatural. Everyone is free to make their choice as to where they get their answers. I've made mine based on which choice I felt was the best supported and most logical, but at the same time, I can respect those who've chosen differently. Whatever works best for them is the choice they should make.  Waxy
You must have missed a logic class. A logical starting point is called "assumption" another item used is "given". That is how one starts a logical process.  Given that evolution is true then.... Given that God exists then...  Maybe I was sleeping that day. I missed your specific definition of assumption. I was working on a slightly different definition.  There is no evidence of God, therefore any mention of his existence is an assumption.  There is plenty of evidence that the physical world around us exists, so no assumption is needed to work from that basis.  I understand the point you're making, that we don't have all the answers regarding cosmic science, abiogenesis, etc..., we can only theorize and attempt to test and verify the theory. However, that simply means we don't have the answers, it's doesn't mean the answers don't exist, or must come from the supernatural.  You're appealing to the "God of the gaps" as evidence for your position.  Evolution does not address the origins of the universe. It only addresses mans origins. God addresses both.  No, numerous other areas of science deal with the origin of the universe.  Evolution addresses the changes in life over time, abiogenesis addresses the origin of life.  The boogeyman addresses both too, the problem is, there's is no way to test the validity of either entity, and therefore no logical reason to conclude that they did have an impact, even if it can't be proven that they didn't.  Agreed that it is at our current level of understanding. However, you then have to assume that a new level of understanding will lead us to a conclusion that GOd did not exist.  You can never prove that God does not exist, I didn't miss that logic class. ;)   It's simply a non-issue as far as science is concerned. Science does not deal with the supernatural.  What you describe is not observable. Period. What I describe is not observable. Period. They both require some level of faith in our assumptions.  What is observable and what isn't observable? I'm lost again.  I also have a feeling that this is quickly boiling down to another debate on the definition of faith.  The question I ask for sake of a logical discussion is  Given: God exists Then: What must GOd be like.  You, from what I read, have determined that God is impersonal and natural. Is that accurate. I have determined based on evidence such as the physical differences in the universe in its very beginning with now (density of matter, speed of light, etc.) that there was no universe to begin with. That time and matter were created. Evolution cannot answer that item, it does not even address it.  EF  Yes, it is. God to me is not a conscious being, and certainly not relational.  I'm unfamiliar with your assertions regarding density and the speed of light, and their relationship to the universe being created. You obviously put a fair bit of stock in this, as it apparently forms the basis for your belief in God. Do you have a link to the info?  I've laid out my thoughts, I figure it's time for you to lay out yours. So far I have down that you believe God is a relational entity without which life would be hopeless.  I think I've successfully challenged the notion that life without God is hopeless, at least I assume so from your lack a response on the subject, so the question is, how do you envision God?  Waxy
Ahhhhh Very good argumentation. There is a great deal of evidence for the existence of God. I am not sure that I would characterize it as scientific, but evidence nonetheless. Certainly documentary evidence and writings concerning God go back a long way. The fact that we actually create is evidence for a creator. There are certain miraculous events which cannot be explained by science or can only be speculated upon by science. The raising of the dead, healing of the terminally ill through prayer (I have witnessed this thing on one occasion without any oddball televangists involved) amongst others. While I will admit there are things there we do not understand, they are still EVIDENCE. It does not mean that there are not other possible explanations but they still support the existence of God.  Sorry EF, I was out of town.  First off - I agree that everything (well almost everything), you've presented can be considered evidence. The question is, is it GOOD evidence? Is it observable, reliable, testable, repeatable, etc...?  Documentary evidence and writings are your best evidence, and as I'm sure you know, they don't form the strongest basis.   The fact that we create is in no way evidence of a creator. That's false logic.  I'm not aware of any documented and scientifically verified cases of anyone being raised from the dead.  "Miracles" most often have explanations, where we have no explanation, God can be inserted, but so can anything, including simply, "I don't know".  Healing of the terminally ill through prayer is pretty much a dead end street. I think that's been proven in this thread.  I don't doubt the "power of prayer" has some positive influence on those that are ill, however, the fact that the prayer is to the Christian God is irrelevent. Prayer means the presence of loved ones and a positive atmosphere, IMHO, that affects the mental state of the patient, and that in turn can help in overcoming illness.   All of this "evidence" is indeterminate in nature, it could support the existance of God, but it could also support the existance of Thor or the boogeyman.   Alternatively, it could simply be that we don't as yet know the answers, and it isn't evidence of anything.  As to my understanding of God. He is relational. He is Love, He is omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent. He is creator, judge, savior, king, prince of peace, wonderful counselor, a strong fortress. He is the beginning and the end, He was before time and will be after time, he brought all things into existence, He defines Good, He is good, he is the lover of my soul. He is my caretaker, my hope and my portion. He is the best thing that ever happened to me.  Interesting.  I have no real objections to your definition, obviously I disagree, but as you've defined god, I can understand the attraction. I think it's a pretty standard definition of God for all put those of the extremes (your EZs).   Irregardless of the omniscience and omnipotence, and the "power" associated with him in your definition, god would make a good parent, sibling or wife.  I do not base my belief in him on something such as the origins of the universe. My belilef is based on the fact that I have tried out what is said to be true about him and found it perfectly sound. I have never been let down by Him and while I cannot always see what He is doing, I am sure that He is involved and has my back.  That is what I believe.  My question then is simple - if that is the case, when why attempt to justify his existence using science, or more specifically logic? Why is faith in god as you've defined him not enough to satisfy you?  Waxy
Lastly, you avoid the actual argument and once again go down a rabbit trail. I made it very clear that what I posted was not proof. It was evidence. Yes there are studies that show the opposite. However, there are 1200 studies summarized by this one professor (and there are many others given the 1200 studies) which clearly show a link. They are double blind, peer reviewed, statistically analyzed using z scores, a two tailed ANOVA, etc.   Once again I am not saying there is proof only evidence. Just because there is evidence to the contrary does not mean that my evidence does not exist.  Please pay attention to the argument.  I agree with you EF, I think trebor has strayed off the track.  It does not mean your evidence does not exist, it does mean that your evidence may not be reliable, or that it may be of questionable value.  I believe that is the point trebor is trying to make.  To put it another way, you're trying to buy a $1 item with $.01. Sure, you've got a penny, no one is denying that, the problem is, the proof costs a dollar.  Waxy
As to the documentary evidence: I would say that my point is that it is as good of evidence as any other document considered historically reliable. For example, consider the new testament. The originals (which we do not have) were written in greek between roughtly 50 and 100 AD. While we do not have the originals there are 5000 manuscripts available with approximately 25000 copies available. Some dating back to as early as 120AD by scientific dating methods.  In comparison for Plato's manuscripts there are only 7 copies in existence and the earliest manuscript is over 1300 years after the fact of the writing. Yet these are absolutely considered to be authored by plato and to be good copies of what he actually wrote.  Norman Geisler makes several key observations for our consideration:  No other book is even a close second to the Bible on either the number or early dating of the copies. The average secular work from antiquity survives on only a handful of manuscripts; the New Testament boasts thousands.  The average gap between the original composition and the earliest copy is over 1,000 years for other books.  The New Testament, however, has a fragment within one generation from its original composition, whole books within about 100 years from the time of the autograph [original manuscript], most of the New Testament in less than 200 years, and the entire New Testament within 250 years from the date of its completion.  The degree of accuracy of the copies is greater for the New Testament than for other books that can be compared. Most books do not survive with enough manuscripts that make comparison possible.  I have no real argument with the above, it's not worth debating the minor details. There's no question that the Bible has been well preserved. The problem is, it's inconsequential to the real issue at hand. It's the best of bad evidence.  Without some way of verifying the text(s), then the Bible is no greater proof of God than Harry Potter books are proof of Harry Potter and witches. I know I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.  Ultimately, the Bible, and God, cannot be proof of God. It's circular reasoning and a logical fallacy.  As to the argument I raised concerning prayer and miracles, I will concede that portion. NOt that I think your correct, simply that I cannot prove it and the evidence for it has alternate explanations. It was a poorly constructed argument on my part with little actual research done. I will do more and if I find something better then I will post.  That's a difficult task. I'm not sure your research will ever turn up what your looking for.  As to your last question: "My question then is simple - if that is the case, when why attempt to justify his existence using science, or more specifically logic? Why is faith in god as you've defined him not enough to satisfy you?"  It is plenty to satisfy me. However, it is not enough to satisfy you and others. My hope is to make you question and think. I also hope to learn more about my own faith and beliefs as you question me. It is good for me. I share it with others BECAUSE it has been good for me. I only wish such goodness for others as well.  EF  You do make me think, far more than most on the board, especially in the religious section, dominated by the likes of EZ et al.   I do absorb the info in these religious discussions, and occassionaly it is challenging, however, far more often than not, the information I'm presented on the side of religion only reinforces my existing beliefs.   I believe we've talked about this before. About the desire of those who believe to somehow justify their beliefs or put them on a concrete, physical footing. Personally, I don't understand it. The choice has been made to have faith in God, something that can never be physical or concrete, at that point, the rest should be irrelevent.  Waxy
Quite correct as far as proof goes. I disagree on the "best of bad" evidence. The evidence is equal in quality to what we already accept of secular documentation. It is even far better. Why then is it acceptable to say that "the bible is unreliable" or "invalid" and then also say that the works of Plato or aristotle are valid and reliable. Which is what happens from most atheists on this board as far as I can see.   Additionally there is plenty of archaelogical evidence of many events in the bible. I believe there was astronomical evidence of an eclipse as described in the bible. There has been discovered a marker with the name Pontius Pilate within the last 20 years I think. There is corroborating evidence as well.   The only real point I make, and I think you actually agree, is that to use one set of documents in an argument and then argue that the other set is unreliable or invalid when it has a greater probability of reliability and validity is simply poppycock.  I do agree, in as much as the Bible can be proven historically accurate, it should be accepted as such.  The difference EF, is that Plato and Aristotle are not used as proof of a supernatural being, global floods, and miracles. Those documents are also not claimed to be perfect and divinely inspired.  They are simply different levels of "validity".   There is also plenty of archeological, geological, etc evidence that contradicts the Bible as well.  Thanks for the discourse.  Thanks to you as well.  Waxy
Actually, you are correct at least to a degree. I would say that what the numbers show is that the people who wrote what is in the new testament believed what they were writing to be true. I would agree that it does not necessarily prove it to be true. Do any of you, trebor, waxy, sinjin, et al, agree?  EF  I don't necessarily agree.  If you're trying to win over converts and increase your strength, the truth of what you're selling, and your belief in that truth, isn't always the most important factor. The world is full of such examples.  They obviously thought it important, and had a strong desire to preserve and preach it, but whether or not they believed it to be completely true, that's another story. Many likely did, as many believe so today, others likely did not, and manipulated it for their gain, or the gain of "the church", as many do today.  Waxy
I've enjoyed this exchange.  It's like a lesson in practical logic. Well done by all. However, I agree that there is no progress being made at this point.   EF - I think the point has been made pretty darn clearly, I have no idea how to present it to you in a different/better manner. I understand your position, and I think the others do as well, but it's been proven wrong IMHO, rather comprehensively. It is of course your perogative as to how to deal with the info you've been given.  Waxy
That is very sexist. It is sad that you are ashamed of being male.
Women have been denigrated and made fun of for centuries. I've just gotten tired of it--and righteously so.  Actually I'm so sure of my manhood that even though I knew that charge would be levelled against me I still posted anyway.   Anyway if you feel that men need to be degraded to make up for past actions to women you have gone from "righteous" to bitter.
Women have been denigrated and made fun of for centuries. I've just gotten tired of it--and righteously so.Did you think we'd all catch your deliberate misuse of words or are you a blonde?  ...can't be both!  Both men and women have been denigrated and made fun of for centuries...men are just better at denigrating and making fun.  I think the Cherokee Indians had the right idea.emoticon_xgood
I do and have, but it's usually lost on the spiritually challenged.Most of your venom is accompanied by OT and "Letters" references.
Well, I could start by counting the number of female priests in your church. Wouldn't take long, would it?  ROFL! That was the greatest comeback I've ever seen here! And it's totally true.
Translation =   Yeah you go girl...whahoo, power to the woman! Maybe we can meet up later tonight and have some fun...I have a great selection of strap-ons...     Uhhmm, ookay?emoticon_wow emoticon_confused While I do happen to be a woman, that would hardly be a thing someone would say to a person with the screenname of johnhanks. It would also be a rather odd thing to say about someone for a comment they made.
It does seem that the only group you're allowed to laugh at in our overly PC society (in the UK at least) is the white male. This worries me slightly because those who get insecure about this sort of thing, can be tempted to move towards far right activism.  I don't personally think that sexism is a thing that should be condoned or endorsed, but I do find that some people have become sensative to the point of stupidity. I laugh at jokes about overweight football supporters (which I am), as much as I laugh at blonde jokes, or jokes about Englishmen, or anyone else. I don't think there is a problem with joking like that, as long as that's all it is. The moment people seriously believe that one sex is inferior, then trouble arrives.  How do you confuse an Englishman?  Put three spades against a wall, and tell him to take his pick... :)
I am seriously offended by that joke, you'll be hearing from my attorney!  Very true (only us pushover white men can get poked fun at). I get carried away sometimes, but only because I can't stand people getting so uptight about so called "sexist" issues...I love to wind people up you see, and woman are the best for that (hehe).  Ps, I've had many a wallop over the head from my fiancée's handbag as a result of some of the posts I've made here LOLOne should never tell an Englishman a joke on Saturday night...eel be loffing 'bout titin church un Soonday!
Where is Maximus to defend the Roman Catholic Church?  Damn it, Maximus, you know I hate it when I have to defend the Roman Catholic Church!

Robinson, Ph.D. Late AD 68 or early 70    I'm sorry but the above is not only a complete waste of space, (if you can't make your point with 10 or less reconsider your position) but notice the earliest date is 40 years after the death of Jesus. A rough average being 60 - 100 years later. Even without the politics and control that came later, the best, most accurate account of Jesus has been spread via word of mouth 1 -3, maybe more, generations after the fact. A lot can get lost, added, altered, forgotten, embellished and so on in that amount of time. Especially considering the source.   The entire NT is speculative. The question can still be asked if Jesus really even existed. Christianity has without question drifted very far from it's roots. The facts that can be confirmed show an NT that has been altered, that has been tightly controlled and minupulated for power, politics and personal glory by an organization that has in the past had no problem with the forgery of ducuments, the destruction and/or defamation of science and thought and the murder and/or torture of it's opponents.   If Christianity was based on what is said Jesus said the NT would probably be 20 pages. All the rest are men who had an opinion and found a way to connect that opinion to something Jesus said.   God is God. Plenty of times in the OT if he wanted you to know something you knew it. He even realized that he needed to be real clear with us (The 10 commandments, set in stone) So what happened that he just said figure it out yourselves?
I am a roman catholic. We do NOT worship Mary! You thinking that is more insulting thatn anything. We "venerate" or "give highest honner" to her. We belive that Jesus said, "Women, behold your son, son, behold your mother". We belive that this makes Mary the mother of the Catholic church.  You do bring up a valid point that bringing in trees for the winter season does come from peagon origens, but christans use it to symbolise the eternal life of God. And, if we celibrate the aniverrsery of when we came to this world, it only makes sense to do the same for Jesus.  Not to mention that bringing in trees for the winter season is not the only thing pagans did to celebrate th winter sulstes, they also did human sacrifices. (someting a true cristian would never do)  Ummm wasn't Jesus a human sacrifice? But he was Jewish so I guess in that respect your right.
Sure I can. Besides, I do know someone who sees spirits regularly.Hmm, what kind of a collection do they have in their liquor cabinet?
Speaking of spirits, Jamesons'?  Or, Bushmills?
Ps, here's just ONE interesting quote I copied from a weegee board forumn:  "I really do not reccommend using a weegee board. Please take my advice as i am only concerned for your safety because of what happened to my good friend james. We set it all up right and we started doing it and it took a while for anything to start happening but when it did it told us that it was an evil spirit. We thought it was a cool idea to keep playing until james put his finger on the glass and at that moment he rolled his head back and the glass shattered and then he gargled blood. Then he went into a spasm and with the 3 blows with his own hand to his head he made his skull collapse and killed himself. The ortopsy showed that the brain had detached from everything. Me and my friend have spent the last 6 months of our lives in a mental hospital only being released because we decided to stop trying to tell the truth."   There are plenty more unpleasant experiences like this one from dabbling with spirits.  Does that sound safe and harmless to you?  That sounds like they are either mad, high or lying. I'd work with high myself.
Damn! What's wrong with my Ouija board? It never did that. I have the most boring Ouija board. It sits there and does nothing.
It only works on interesting people...heheROFL! Touche!
Dante's inferno had all those who never knew Jesus in the first circle of hell, so technically Ghandi and all those children are running forever into a strong wind....
First, I drink two glasses of fine Scotch. I then find my favorite mind altering substance, and smoke it. I then go outside in the summer night, and watch the stars. lmao emoticon_xhoho
It is all relative to our perspective Matt, so from the perspective of the Age of Grace, the Age of the Law seemed harsh. But don't forget that the same God who gave us the Age of the Law, also gave us the Age of Grace which we currently reside in. And you can thank what Jesus did for this Age. So in other words, you're saying that somewhere along the lines, God changed his mind.
First, I drink two glasses of fine Scotch. I then find my favorite mind altering substance, and smoke it. I then go outside in the summer night, and watch the stars.  Or the ramblings of those who indulge in this sort of thing, relyed second/third hand and delivered with sincerity and lack of editing.
What if it was his plan all along. I cannot see a better way to demonstrate love that is freely given and freely received. Which could lead us to yet another topic which is "what is love". Has anyone done that one yet or should I start a thread?  Huck Inconsistency sure seems like an odd way to show it.
I know this is going to hurt you, but it needs to be pointed out. Did God make Mentally Retarded Children as they are ? Or Mongoloids ?  Did you actually just say mongoloid?
Homosexuality is not an impairment, any more than being blue-eyed, left-handed, red-haired... or heterosexual.
"Allowing" it to happen is the same as him making them that way. I disagree. Big Orn is right. Only Calvinists and other determinists hold to this.
"Allowing" it is making a choice by default. Yes, but this would only show add support to a determinist argument if there was only one possible outcome of God "allowing" whatever it was.  For example, let's say a mosquito lands on my arm. I know it will bite me. I can swat it, or I can do nothing. Doing nothing would be allowing it to bite me and since I have the power to stop it, allowing it to bite me would essecntially be the same as choosing it to bite me (to a certain extent).  But our world isn't so simple. There is not only one possible outcome of God allowing us to have free will. There is a potentially infinite number of outcomes.  Even from this example, one can see that it is more complex than that. I didn't choose for the mosquito to come to land on me in the first place for example.
Well, if he doesn't know-of/allow these things, then He's not really God, now is He? There's no way to believe in God without subscribing to the view that he allows or causes these things. Otherwise, He's no God after all. It's not "radical religion"--it's straight logic. If you're going to subscribe to the idea of an 'all-powerful' being, then you don't get to suddenly pretend he's not really all-powerful. Read my last post.
Inconsistent from my limited, finite, colored and distorted viewpoint? I suppose , if you want to rest all your weight on such a thing.  Don't get me wrong. I'm no more ready to accept it all than you, I simply cannot deny the objective facts of it all.  Huck You say I only see it as inconsistent because I don't have the mind of God (which would be impossible for me to have of course) and then say this is all based on "objective facts" which we can have. Which is it? Also, what "objective facts" are you referring to exactly?
Actually, that is an incorrect summation.  The point about objective facts are what the scripture says about God's nature and the logic of him being the way he is described. It all fits nicely. If he is infinite then it would make sense that he would be the one who sets the standards and the one who says whether or not those standards are correct.  I am alluding to other things there but that statement is not really that material to the argument. If the christian God is as described in the bible (and lets face it, if we are talking about the christian god then we have to accept the bible as the authority on his nature, we have little other choice), then for me to say He is inconsistent or unloving is a little like a painting complaining about the painters skills.  Huck If you view scripture as "objective facts" than we are obviously coming from a very different view of what the bible is. I thought you were taking more of the approach of a philosopher/theologian as opposed to a believer here.  It doesn't fit nicely. It is inconsistent to say "Ok, here's how it's gonna go. I'm going to give you some odd hundred laws. You have to follow these laws or you will be impure and unrighteous"..........fast forward to several thousand years later...."Nevermind all that. I've got this guy here now. Just believe in him and you'll be fine. All of you who didn't make the cut under the old rules? Sorry, my bad."
Maybe I should start another thread about this, but it seems relevant here, so here it goes.  Here, in a nutshell, is the problem with the idea that God is in control of everything, or to blame for everything, or behind everything. Whatever phrase you want to use.  If this is so, it means that God has already chosen who will "choose" him and be saved, and those that will not "choose" him and go to hell. If, as in this situation, we do not have any control over our own outcome, then there can be no criterion by which to choose who goes to heaven and who goes to hell. This means that it has to be chosen arbitrarily. To use Calvin's own imagery, God is holding everyone in his hands over the fires of hell and letting some slip through his fingers. The idea that God is arbitrary runs completely counter to the idea that God is entirely purposeful and deliberate.  Free will is what gives life, and this world, purpose. Otherwise, we are just unknowing cogs in a machine, unknowing players in a twisted, cosmic, tragic comedy.  Determinism, or whatever phrase you prefer to use, makes God arbitrary and life meaningless. Does this sound like the kind of God you believe in or would want to believe in?
If you're saying that human freedom and an omniscient God are not incompatible, I would agree. Yup, that is what I was saying, among other things.  MS, I agree except for the part where you link "in control" and "blame" as being the same. I just mentioned all the terms I had seen being used here to be inclusive.  He can be in control and still not cause bad things to happen. Because He is in control, He will not interfere with our choices. If He had preset my outcome from birth, then how am I to truly choose? And if He preset those things that directly affect me, then how can I overcome adversity. Because He is in control, I am permitted to make mistakes, or become successful. I'm with you in the first half, but you lost me at the end there. Are you saying God "presets things that directly affect you" (obstacles) because God knows how you will react and is trying to teach you something?  If He can't change things, then prayer would be an exercise in futility. I agree. BTW - I don't think hell is a place, either. For the lack of a better word, I believe it is a direction that eventually leads to spiritual death. I don't believe Hell is a place either (or even if I believe in hell to begin with), but tell me more about what you mean by this. It sounds interesting.
I am not taking the stance as a believer. Philosopher theologian would be reasonable. I see the evidence for the bible to be fairly good evidence. It is better than most evidence we use when referring to other historical events of this antiquity. The sheer volume of documentation is overwhelming concerning the bible. There are other things too. Well, I guess I'll just leave this where it stand and we will just have to agree to disagree lest we get into a discussion over the historical validity of the bible. There are plenty of threads on that subject, and I don't want to distract too much. Besides, I think as long as we're more concerned with the theological, I think we'll be fine.  It is very consistent of a God who is love, and who wants love (freely given love) to show people that they are not able to do it on thier own. Hence the purpose fo the law. It was there to show people the need for god. God has always said that belief in him is what leads to justification. Even in the old testament when Abraham (then abram) is told that Sarah (then sarai) will bear him a son (even in their ninetys) it says "and abram believed god and he was declared righteous." This happens before abram tries to have a son or sacrifice his son or any of that. He merely believed. God called him righteous.   NOw, in the new testament, God sends his own son so that "whosoever" should believe in him would be saved. I find this remarkably consistent.  Huck. To do what on their own? Love?  I have more I want to say here, but I want to be clear on your message first.
How do you see God  I don't.  I'd say it's impossible to 1) See something that dosn't exist (without being manipulated by mind control practices or illegal substances to hallucinate) or 2) to see something that so powerful and paranoid and neurotic as to not want to be seen.
It sounds like a few folks think that God "creates" or "allows" mentally retarded people. Does He create or "make happen" the lightning that strikes the golfer or the hurricane that smashes seaside towns? Sounds like some radical religionist's hype.  Does He cause the little bird to fall from the nest or is He just aware of it?  At the onset of humanity, He told Adam and Eve that the earth is here for them (mankind). He told them to take care of it. He said nothing about taking over if they (we) couldn't handle it.  Blaming God for all the things, both good and bad, that happen is a mistake, imho. Some things just happen. Does that mean that God's not in control? No, it only reinforces that He still is.  So, you haven't read ALL the bible? I covered this in the thread on respecting others beliefs. There are plenty of passages that state God does ALL this you say. Calvinism is based on such beliefs.  Believing otherwise would deny, in part, the sovereignty of the Lord. We may not know the reasons or could only speculate in our finite knowledge. But, if you believe in the WHOLE bible, things don't just happen, but contribute by design to His inefible plan. There are reasons for all if you look outside the box.  A mental retard can lead me to become more compassionate to those less fortunate. Personally, I'd inately abort them or kill them* and not waste the resources of them but, when around them, I do find myself patient and kind.  * Yes, I have the capacity like most all humans to be cruel and callous...for a 'higher cause' of course.  Daily though, I'm reminded how scripturally illiterate professed believers are or how their own desires force them to interpret scripture to find new meaning to conform to their wants rather than the other way around.
It takes a person many, many years to completely understand all the things the Bible has to offer. I'm nowhere close.  I have my beliefs just as you have yours. I can't, in all honesty, say that I have all the answers.  What I can do, though, is lay mine out for someone. There might be just one person that needs what little I have to offer - if so, then my time is well spent. I have learned many things, and have changed my view accordingly. I can say that those changes have been for the better.   Thank you. That is one of the most honest and sincearest sounding responses I've seen in a long time.
To say emotions are not measurable is a bit misleading. They are measurable but the measure is a subjective measure. There is no standard for emotional measurement (like there is with the meter etc.).  However, emotional responses can be subjectively rated by those that experience them. for example:  Please rate the following on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being the saddest event and 10 being the happiest event:  Wedding Funeral Cat stuck in a tree Tuna gone bad toilet overflowing foreclosure   People can rate their emotional reactions to the events. In fact that is a fairly prominent counseling tool. To say that they are not measurable is not precisely correct. To say that there is no real objective measure would be accurate. Emotions by nature are subjective and therefore their measurement MUST be subjective.  Huck
Oh no one said that emotions are not measurable. We are saying that emotions are not scientifically measurable.   jackamarra is essentially arguing that if something cannot be scientifically proven (aka measurable) then it does not exist (such as God).   I presented three emotions we obviously all know about but cannot be measured scientifically.   How much forgiveness can you put in a beaker?   At what temperature does hope break down?   What individual parts constitute love?  Scientific measurement includes the subjective. Again the issue is objectivity. It can still be done scientifically which is a process of hypotesis and controls.  It cannot be done 100% objectively, but then nothing is 100% objectively measured. Because there is always room for error in the measurer.  Huck
No belief system can ever be proved. Your viiw of what is most realsonable is as valid as anyone else's At the moment the hot debate is over materialism vs. non materialism.  Materialism in this context is not about an obsession with money. Nor is it about the existence or non existence of God. It concerns a definition of reality. Materialists see the universe, including living organisms, as consisting of nothing more than purposeless matter in motion -- a complex machine lacking any intelligence or volition. We non materialists see subjective choice (free will) and intelligent causation (intelligent design) as non supernatural aspects of reality. Only a committed materialist would question the reality of free will in humans and other mammals. However some materialist do just that, claiming that free will is an illusion, that what we mistake for rational free choice is nothing more than mechanical, deterministic interactions of the brain.   Many materialists are atheists, and many non materialists are religious, attributing everything to God. However theism is not the only alternative to materialism. Panpsychism, for instance, proposes that free-will, subjective choice, has always been a basic ingredient of reality. The "laws" of nature are merely entrenched habits of a spontaneous, volitional, creative reality. "Laws" concerning inanimate matter are habits so entrenched that deviations cannot be detected by existing measuring methods (except perhaps at the quantum level). Living organisms, on the other hand, all retain some limited ability to respond creatively and purposefully. Living organisms can be easily observed overriding habits, instincts and "laws" of nature, The universe is an intelligent democracy in the process of designing itself. The "design" of inanimate matter may be pretty entrenched by this time, but living organisms are still to some extent a design in process.   At the moment the materialists seem to be in control of academia, and they are not shy about wielding their power to silence non materialistic views. They harass and deny tenure to scientists who question materialism. Some materialists go so far as to claim materialism is the only permissible "scientific" view of reality, and they have persuaded a court to prohibit theories involving free will and intelligent causation from being considered in biology classrooms. I doubt an overwhelming majority of the public would define themselves as materialists if they gave the matter serious consideration. In any case, I'm confident that only a few in our society are so intolerant as to condone banning conflicting views from consideration.   Freud, Marx and Darwin have often been named as the three materialists of the 20th Century. Marxism is in decline. Darwinism is being hotly debated. Freud suggested that our thoughts were a mechanical process, over which we have little control. Few people still accept the Freudian notion that faulty parenting cause autism, mental illness or homosexuality. However some people still argue that 'thinking' is nothing more than mechanical brain interactions and chemical reactions.  I'd love to have you join me at my web site where I explore such questions, but apparently I have to do 10 posts before I'm allowed to post link. Hopefully this will count as number 1.  Berthajane Vandegrift
Darwinism is hotly debated? where in Church?  I agree with all of materialism positions including free will. Free will is an illusion unless you think there is a ghost in the machine.  As per bertvan:  "Only a committed materialist would question the reality of free will in humans and other mammals. Materialists see the universe, including living organisms, as consisting of nothing more than purposeless matter in motion. A complex machine lacking any intelligence or volition."  Thanks bertvan. This forum needed someone like you.
Popper informs us that one cannot prove a hypothesis, the best we can do is to reenforce it by showing it is true in certain circumstances.
My belief system says all belief systems are false, including my own.   I don't believe you.   Prove it.
I don't believe I will.  We finally agree on something!  emoticon_xhoho
We finally agree on something!  emoticon_xhoho   I don't believe you do.;)

Yeah I can believe it if you can believe that.
Man this is giving me a headache, not from thinking, but from laughing.:)
Man this is giving me a headache, not from thinking, but from laughing.:)  Your belief that this is funny is incorrect because I believe that it's not that funny.
I'm not going to debate this with you but here is one explanation of the Doctrine of Hell from the Protestant perspective. Specifically the Calvinist perspective. And this isn't to say that I am a Calvinist either so don't make any assumptions. I read it though and agreed with it although I would have added some information it doesn't such as Hell was created for the devil and his angels, not man. We go there by choice. If you believe people go to hell by choice, why you would use Calvinist thought to explain your thinking is beyond me, but suit yourself.
This is another good point. I too find it imposible to believe in God not saving those that have been forced away - thousands upon thousnds of people are pushed away from Christianity when they hear the hateful rhetoric and fearmongering of preachers like Phelps, Hovind, Falwell, Pat Roberts, Bakker, Oral Roberts, Archangel, and pretty much any evangelical preacher. Most Atheists have had some sort of past experience with Christianity, and that experience pushes them away from the Church - usually it is the rhetoric preached by many evangelical churches.  That is why I believe what I do - my beliefs are quite similar to yours. emoticon_xgood  You speak of AP's "hatred" but take shots at him with every post that you make. Don't you see the hypocricy in that? emoticon_confused
I really don't recall ever attacking the AssociatedPress - in fact, I respect all of the work that is done by them to get the news out to everyone. emoticon_confused  Oops, I meant AA. emoticon_emb
Ah, that makes more sense.  As to "pot-shots" against AA, I merely reply in kind to his "pot-shots" at me (which usually include denigrating remarks against women in general).  The post you quoted in particular (which makes more sense now given you meant AA, thanks), isn't a "potshot" at all, it was me expressing the truth as I see it.  Like I said. emoticon_rolleyes
 It is speaking to the "CULTURAL CHRISTIANS"... Non-christians, you mean...I hope...which means they shouldn't even have the label at all.  Atheists, agnostics, etc., etc. are not called "cultural atheists" or "cultural agnostics", they are who they are.  This forum is full of junk like this. Matthew has the Upper Case Christians and the Lower Case Christians. Somebody else has "so-called" Christians. The Name of Christ shouldn't even be in the mix. JMHO on that.  ...christians who believe homosexuality is ok with God.  ARGH!!!!!! :xbanghead
 It's also why I refer most loosers to go to a Church when in a crisis when they can't handle proper and useful advice.  So that's why churches are so full of losers...  Y'all remind me not to ask Zardoz for references.
Still less do they blame Satan or whatever or expect to have their 'magic' card. I have known quite a few, but they were new to it; they didn't understand where Satan has been placed since Christ, and would really get down in the dumps.  I think, at first, when new believers start learning, they get the gist of it, but really don't understand how evil can influence in such a powerful way. If they stay faithful, though, and grow in the spirit, they come to see that bad things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people and life goes on. The old adage, "The devil made me do it!", won't hold shucks anymore.
The Jesus seekers throughout history have found what they were predisposed to look for. Modern seekers find a historical Jesus who thinks like them, agrees with them, and no doubt would vote like them. The liberal searchers have found a liberal Jesus, the liberationists a Jesus of the class struggle, etc.   Do any of these figures correspond to the "real" Jesus of Nazareth - if he can be reconstructed from the gospels?   James.
American Capitalist Christianity is an invention: there is no such political movement.  Christians are found all across the political spectrum in the United States and elsewhere.  James.
From Humanist In Canada magazine, Spring 2000 Why God Likes Atheists Best Wurt Keinheimer  First of all, atheists aren't always asking God for stuff. YOu don't hear atheists going around saying "Oh God, please give me a Sony Play Station!" or "Dear Lord, please don't let me lose my erection now!" or Heavenly Father, don't let my daughter get a nipple ring!"  I mean, think about it from God's point of view. He listens to that kind of stuff, and lots worse, from His believers twenty-four hours a day, three hundred and sixty-five days a year, millennium after millenium, no weekends off, no vacations and no overtime pay. After a while that has got to get old. So God probably really appreciates His atheists for procurring their own Sony Play Stations and erections and whatnot.  But that's not the only reason God likes atheists best. He also really digs it that atheists don't go around gossiping and spreading rumours about Him like His believers are always doing. You don't hear atheists talking about how God is this kind of guy or that kind of guy, or how God caused this terrible event or did thus-and-such to so-and-so.  Heck! How would you feel if everybody and their brother was spouting off about what you did or why you do the things you do? Cuz you know it all gets back to Him in the end, right? After all, he is God.  I figure one of these days He's gonna come looking for everybody that's been spreading rumours and gossip about Him. He'll come down from Heaven and round up all the Baptists and Rosicrucians and Hindus and Buddhists and Jews and Moonies and Quakers and Shakers and Episcopalians and all His other believers. Then He'll gather them unto him in the Sky Dome in Toronto and really let them have it!  He'll say, "Who do you think you are, talking about me behind my back? Who are you to say Who I am? How dare you define Me?!"  Now, you gotta figure those blievers are gonna be feeling pretty embarrassed when He confronts them that way and they'll probably go all quiet and sheepish and contrite. So, being a skilled orator, God will no doubt seize the opportunity of the silence in the Sky Dome to press His point, verily saying, "From now on, mind your own business, like My atheists do. You take care of the human stuff. I'll take care of the God stuff. And if I ever need you to define me, which is highly unlikely, I will let you know. Till then, just keep your mouth shut about Me."  Of course, being God, He might word it a bit differently but I'm sure that would be the gist of His Message. And boy oh boy! Wouldn't you love to be there to hear Him give His Message? I know I would. But, being an atheist, I might not be invited. At the very least, God probably won't be sending me complimentary tickets to that particular Sky Dome event. But hey, I figure that's why he created ticket scalpers.  Anyway, there's another reason God likes atheists best. In His guise as God the Father, arguably the best parent ever, He's gotta love the self-reliant independence of His athiest offspring. He's gotta adore the fact that His atheist kids stand on thier own two feet and aren't forever tied to His spiritual apron springs. And it must be no small comfort to Him that His atheist boys and girls don't blame Him for their failures and don't expect Him to provide for their successes. Heck! He must feel immense pride and relief that His athesit progeny take responsibility for their own actions and realize that their own actions are the only thing they have to make the world a better place.  Dang! Is it any wonder God likes atheists bests? Of course not. It's only logical. Besides, I'm an atheist, so I know on a level beyond logic, that atheists are His favourites, His chosen people, His representatives on earth.   After all, I just created this God for the purposes of this essay and I'd have to be crazy not to have Him like me best. Wouldn't I?
Very humorous. And maybe closer to the truth than one dare imagine... emoticon_xgood
Well...I never.  Everyone knows God loves me most or my name isn't Saddam Hussein!  Why, I even have some pics of me and the old luvy dovey. Here.  Jealous?  You should be.
No, not true at all. G-d desires for us to willingly love Him suprememly and for our lives to be guided by Him just as any earthly father would guide his own children. Hell is a place of utter torment that people, who reject G-d, choose to end up in. Consequences of our decisions have eternal signifigance. Absolutely reprehensible comment. How in the same breath can you say that God desires us to willingly love him, and if we don't, he will consign us to hell for an eternity of torture? And it would have been our choice! What madness. Love me or be tortured! Is that a free and willing expression of love? Is that really how you imagine a father guides his children? Barking mad.  "The God of hell should be held in loathing, contempt and scorn. A god who threatens eternal pain should be hated, not loved; cursed, not worshipped. A heaven presided over by such a god must be below the meanest hell." - Ingersoll  "Nothing proves the man-made character of religion as obviously as the sick mind that designed hell, unless it is the sorely limited mind that has failed to describe heaven - except as a place of either worldly comfort, eternal tedium, or (as Tertullian thought) continual relish in the torture of others." - Christopher Hitchens, God is Not Great  Do you ever wonder why your God gets rejected when his qualities are as you describe?
You didn't exactly - or at all - address the question. God is basically saying love me or be tortured for eternity. How can your meaning be any other?  And if Christ was a complete sacrifice for our sins, shouldn't he be suffering for an eternity as that would be the only logical propitiatory sacrifice, seeing that Adam has been condemned for eternity?  So if some people die and go to hell, that means they've been judged. What, therefore, is the purpose of the general resurrection? Condemned souls coming out of hell? Or pulled out of heaven? What is the state, and where as those who will be resurrected?
Bassman, you're still avoiding answering the questions. Your interpretation of Revelation does nothing in this regard. What sort of god wants people to willingly love him, only to torture for eternity those that don't? No longer is it willingness, but compulsion out of fear.  Hence the hold that Christianity has on the gullible.  Do you really expect people to love and appreciate your version of God, when he can just as easily turn round and condemn to hell and torture for eternity? Really?
So how should one address people who believe in fairytales? Just because beliefs are sincerely held does not in the slightest make them valid.  I don't know that any non-believer sets out deliberately to insult; it's rather a case of seeing otherwise sensible people being led astray by myth and the feelings that come from that.  I'm glad you said that some people are usually sensible enough not to take all the Bible literally. But the same 'sensible' people can just as easily shout down 'fundies' for their literalistic interpretations. We then see Christians at each other's throats. Yup. Very sensible.  So if the Bible is the word of God, why are there 'fundies' and non-fundies? And that is one reason why some of us here see such nonsense in religion.  Not personal, not arrogant. Just expressing what we see. Nonsense, and nonsense beliefs.
It is puzzling why many posters insult millions of people, calling them gullible, mentally retarded etc for believing in God.  Millions of people are neither gullible nor stupid, yet they are devout believers in Christianity, Islam, Judaism or whatever  Their beliefs are sincerely and honestly held.  They are usually sensible enough to believe that the Bible is not literally correct. They do take its teaching seriously, they do believe in God and the hereafter.  Yet in your arrogance they are all dismissed as simple-minded  Yet, for some reason, you have no problem when children are dispelled of their beliefs in such things as Santa Clause and the Tooth fairy?
... Do you really mean the Tooth fairy doesn't exist ? Can you prove it ?emoticon_ic Glad you've got a sense of humour, or you would have sounded quite the clown with that old line. emoticon_xgood
Santa Claus was based on a true story from long ago.  Do you really mean the Tooth fairy doesn't exist ? Can you prove it ?emoticon_ic  Yet, St. Nicholas is long dead and only the bizarre customs of parents keep the legend going... Sound familiar?  As for the tooth fairy... Can you prove that monkey's haven't ever jumped out of me backside?  There have been public viewings of both... Much more evidence than that tooth fairy has gotten.  In an ironic issue, my youngest has just lost 6 baby teeth in the past week. No tooth fairy has ever visited him...cause I'm a cheap bum...but, I do have a collection of all of his lost teeth. MuAhahahahah...
... Can you prove that monkey's haven't ever jumped out of me backside? There have been public viewings of both... cause I'm a cheap bum... I do wonder about people that refer to their nether regions twice in the same post... :p
And why are they bizarre ? Unless of course keeping the kernel of truth on aspects of morality is bizarre. It's bizarre because of the extraordinary lengths filled with waste, pomp and ritual gone through just for a kernel...that, more often than not seems lost in the mass of untruths. The kernel of morality is in fine print on the backside of the greeting card.  A better idea would be to simply teach the whole ear of corn's worth of morality and use more apt object lessons relevant to todays time.  There are strong simularities between St. Nick and the Christ. The only difference seems to be to what length people are willing to take the ruse and how much emphasis they want to put on the story.  St. Nick, aka Santa Clause, could very well become a diety worshiped by billions. Today, we belive we know that that simply is silly. But, a few generations down the road...would you cry foul or accept it and respect it because that's what should happen?   Christmas practices are perpetuated throughout nearly all cultures. We know it to be myth and a lie pulled over on small, simple minded, children. Why isn't religion any different? Moral lessons.  Please.  Getting gifts is a moral lesson too. (so is giving them for some)
Wouldn't 'bashing' be against forum rules?"Confessions of a 'Moderator'"emoticon_rolleyes
Nope. They've just been eating too many Oreos. emoticon_wowGood God! EZ! They've let you out.  May I presume that the meds are working?
I guess your comprehension skills leave something to be desired. Or was believing the 1800s number just more convenient for the point you wanted to make. How nice it must be in life to be able to determine what truth is most convenient for you and let that be the determining factor as to what you will believe is true. But anyway, as I originally said, the born again movement started with, and was created by Jesus Christ. And unlike your assumptions that it was started in the 1800s, here's the evidence that say's otherwise.  Jhn 3:3 Jesus answered and said to him, "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."  Jhn 3:7 Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'  1Pe 1:23 having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever   This goes to show on how HUGE amounts of theology can be done on bad translations. The original Greek is more accurately translated by 'Born from above'. which is a term meaning there is a love of God.
It's true Jo... "All have sin and fall short of the glory of God" because we all have within up a sin nature. We all share in the corrupted seed from Adam. But Jesus came and sacraficed Himself for our sins that if we believe upon Him that we shall not parish, but have eternal life.  Very Christian attitude. One of the very many reasons I reject Christianity.  It makes no sense what so ever, and it has a real big misreading of Genesis.
No matter what religion we are, we are human, we stray, we sin, WE ARE NOT PERFECT. But many religions preach forgiveness for sins. God forgives.  I'm perfect.

I just realized that both Sam and Mae's posts are years old, and they are probably no longer posting here.   Sorry.  Nothing to be sorry for. Winston revived the thread because he is trolling. He just got permanently banned from another forum and is trying to renew his attempts to start a flame war in this forum.
you and mae got banned first.  when I tried to have her banning lifted, they banned me because they thought I was mae. Ridiculous!!  That forum was the only one I have been banned from and as I said not for trolling.  mae on the other hand has been banned from several forums including this one. I interceded and got her back.  Are you the same Winston Smith who on 5/8 bade farewell to forums and blogs?
how are you doing, old messenger boy ? emoticon_xbye  You are skating on very thin ice. People have been prosecuted for less slanderous statements than what you left behind in the SF forum.
I would think the percentage of sterile men or women in a hetero marriage who can never have kids is probably pretty close to the % of people in the general population who are gay. So I don't think your point is valid Winny.
Well Easyrider, I don't think I'm going to believe Lifesite News(an anti-gay site), nor whomever "Dr.C." is, the person who won't even give a name.  There are no diseases unique to homosexuals, as your site claims. Heterosexuals get the same diseases, and surveys show that the diseases are astoundingly common among heterosexuals, always have been---  http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/Articles/000,015.pdf  (scroll down to page 5, "medical consequences of heterosexuality).  I mean who ridiculous is it to try to link testicular cancer to homosexuality? It's not as though a man will pick up cancer by having contact with another man's testicals. Women do get cervical cancer by the same virus(HPV) that causes anal cancer in some gay men. Cervical cancer in women who have practiced heterosexuality, is so common, that Guardasil is univerisally being applied to protect young women, in many jurisdictions.  How does being gay make one more at risk for obesity, as Lifesite claims?
Most respondents reported experience of discrimination, with a high proportion attributing it to their sexuality. These factors appear to be linked with higher rates of mental disorder.

<flush<  God doesn't accept illicit gay sex sin.  And what did Jesus try to tell carnal sinners? REPENT?   Where's the repentance?  So don't give me that "God accepts gay marriage, etc." garbage. That's the liberal left chanting that, not God.  And I'm sure you of all people know the mind of God... Please, you just take snippets of scripture, and twist it into well this is absolute. God loves gays and lesbians, but you fling god out as a way to justify your slander and bigotry.       Doctors Say Legalizing Same-Sex Marriage Will Give False Impression Gay Sex is Safe  OTTAWA, February 18, 2005 (LifeSiteNews.com) - The looming legalization of same-sex marriage has pushed several doctors to begin speaking out on the harmful medical consequences of homosexual sex. In addition to the group of physicians who presented their findings to Parliament in a referenced brief last week (see LifeSiteNews.com coverage Same-Sex 'Marriage' a Health Risk Doctors Warn Parliamentarians ), two other doctors have approached LifeSiteNews.com to submit evidence but requested anonymity based on fear of retribution from homosexual activists.  Lifesite news.... Oh come on.. Want to post some things from NOM as well? I'm sure everyone will take that seriously too.   The doctors noted that they are concerned for individuals practicing dangerous homosexual sex practices but also for society in that the normalization of such sex practices through same sex 'marriage' legislation will result in a major added burden on health care.  Gays and Lesbians engaging in a monogamous sexual act with their husband or wife will add a burden on health care? who writes this ####??    "Legalization of same sex marriage by the government would give the false message that homosexual sex practices, such as anal intercourse, as long as 'practiced safely', are not endangering the health of the partners," said Dr. C.  Oh lord.... And heterosexuals are just as much at risk for HIV and STDS as gays and lesbians. Once again playing the fear card on the ignorant...    Providing rather explicit details which she felt the public must be aware of, she explained, "Anal intercourse causes abrasions of the relatively fragile rectal wall, especially in the receptive partner. The penetration of E.coli, always present in the stool, and other bacteria, viruses and parasites penetrate through such lesions into the deeper body tissues. This leads to the suppression of the immune system of such individuals even if there is no exposure to HIV. The immune suppression increases the risk to develop certain cancers, opportunistic infections, to which otherwise one would be resistant, and other health problems including the risk of premature death."   What does anal sex have to do with marriage? What if a gay couple doesn't have sex? Some argument this is. And one who engages in this "act" as listed above. I can say this is defunct garbage. Any health care professional will tell you otherwise that isn't on the radical right's payroll that is.     Information on the health risks of gay sex is available from the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association (GLMA). A survey by members of the GLMA released in August 2002 listed the main health problems affecting homosexual men. According to Christopher E. Harris, MD, GLMA President and Vincent M.B. Silenzio, MD, MPH, there are increased health risks for homosexual men.  Once again health risks of unprotected sex and multiple partners, etc. Not a monogamous relationship where both have been tested and given the Ok...    The most common health problems in homosexual men are:  1. Increased incidence of infectious diseases  - HIV/AIDS*  - syphilis - gonorrhea - chlamydia  - pubic lice  - hepatitis A - hepatitis B - hepatitis C - anal papilloma  2. Increased incidence of cancer especially - colon/rectal - prostate - testicular  3. Increased incidence of eating disorders  - bulimia - anorexia nervosa - obesity  4. Increased incidences of other psychological problems - anxiety - depression - suicide  5. Increased incidence of addiction problems especially  - tobacco - alcohol - street drugs - amyl nitrates (poppers)  See also Physician Says Science of Medical Consequences of Homosexual Behaviour is Being Trumped by Political Agenda Physician Says Science of Medical Consequences of Homosexual Behaviour is Being Trumped by Political Agenda  Doctors Say Legalizing Same-Sex Marriage Will Give False Impression Gay Sex is Safe  I just love this list. And what risks does the heterosexual community have? None of this??? I just LOVE how people can whip up a fresh batch of bull and just slap it onto a website to spread lies and misinformation...   And also WHAT DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MARRIAGE?????
Let us round up a hundred or so "married" gay couples and another hundred or so "married" lesbian couples and then dump the gays in one deserted island and the lesbians in another one. Both isolated from civilization. we would supply them with food, medical care, gay magazines etc.  Let's see how this 'normal' marriages would reproduce? I wonder how the population growth would compare between both groups?? emoticon_rolleyes  That's not reality. It will never happen. All you are saying is that it takes a male and a female to reproduce in nature. What does marriage have to do with it? One could have reproduction without any marriage, without love. Would the fact that the couple reproduced mean their marriage is safe and good, and they will never be unhappy and seek a divorce? Marriage must perform functions other than putting a penis in a vagina and hoping the egg fertilizes, and the fertilized egg implants.
Winny...There are already too many people anyway. I wish there were even more gay dudes and I could be the last strait guy on earth!
and what if the last woman on earth was a dyk# ? emoticon_cry  So what.... And your assumption and example is ridiculous.
why do gays and lesbians try so hard to be considered normal? Accept your fate, you are not normal. It is not your fault if you are a man who feels, talk, and moves like a woman and vice versa.  What an idiotic, backward, caricature. It's not normal to hold to that belief in this day and age.
It is not a belief dahhhhlin' is a fact dahhlin'   well, then you are walking caricatures of men trying to walk, talk and behave like women and have sex like women.  marriage is the union of 2 heterosexuals. Period.  anything else is a sad mimicry.  A sad mimicry? Please... I know many same sex married couples who are happy and are raising a family. Your false assumption and prejudice form of opinion is sad..
It is not a belief dahhhhlin' is a fact dahhlin'  Who talks like that? No one I know.   well, then you are walking caricatures of men trying to walk, talk and behave like women and have sex like women.  What do you know about gay sex? Where did you come by this information?  marriage is the union of 2 heterosexuals. Period.  Not where I live.  anything else is a sad mimicry.  Unless you've been involved in a same-sex relationship, and have some knowledge of it, both of which you have not demonstrated, you don't know what you're talking about.
You are preaching to the converted, I am on your side on this one for I would also never but never would have sex a man. Gimme a woman, even a hairy one anytime. emoticon_xagree  Yeah...sputter....:p You care soo friggin much about what two men do in bed, and jump up and down to reassure us it has absolutely no affect on your life. He doth protest too much, people!  I'll tell you what. Being the magnanimous individual I am, I will cease having sex with men, just to make you happy.
I contend that: Atheists have no framework for morality.  Morality only comes from Christianity.   ....Are there no moral Jews, no moral Hindus, no moral Muslims?  I think morality comes from compassion and caring for others more than from religion. I do not doubt that there were peoples with a degree or morality before Christ arrived and sparked Christianity.   Maybe our connotations of moral amd immoral need clarifying. What is it that makes you think there are no moral atheists?
Since ChristAscended is not tending to his thread, and since most posts are not observing the twin rules of staying on topic and avoiding ad hominems, I'm closing the thread.
Answers include but are not limited to:  People need a solution for the Problem of Evil.  People want to have an "objective" standard for good and evil.  God said it, I believe it, that settles it.  Mormons believe that Satan is the brother of Jesus.
People likely believe in Satan, if for nothing else, than because they'll have somebody to blame for their own actions so they won't have to take responsibility.  So basically Satan is the personification of a liberalistic ideal, nobody is responsible for their own actions, somebody else is to blame.
