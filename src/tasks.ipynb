    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply the natural language technologies, such as n-gram and stemming, we've learned in class to generate useful features and evaluate their effectiveness on classifying argument discussions into 10 labeled topic groups. The architecture for this task is as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](imgs/task1-arch.png \"Architecture\")\n",
    "\n",
    "According to our observation, people often use different keywords when discussing different topics. We propose a keyword-based approach to classify dicussions into topics. The intuition is to identify keywords that are not generally used but only used in some specific topics, so we can classify a discussion based on the keywords occurred in the discussion. Therefore, we develop a stemmed unigram representation to represent a discussion. We compare this representation with the state-of-the-art Doc2Vec (Le and Mikolov, 2014) model. In the experiments, we evaluate the effectiveness of stemmed unigram and Doc2Vec in a classification task."

    "#### Stemmed Unigram\n",
    "\n",
    "For each discussion, \n",
    "1. We filtered characters that are neither numbers nor english letters (e.g. \"[A-Za-z0-9]\" in regular expression). \n",
    "2. We filtered stopwords in text. The stopword list, which contains 2,400 stopwords for 11 languages, is from the stopword corpus created by Porter et al. (2001). \n",
    "3. We adopted Porter stemmer to convert words in dicussions to their stemmed form. There are 98,988 distinct stems used in our dataset.\n",
    "4. We took the stems as unigrams and built an unigram occurrence vector as the representation of discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the number of unigrams is large, most of representation vectors are sparse. It is an known issue which may affect classification performance. Our future goal would be adopt some dimension reduction methods to reduce the size of feature vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Doc2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "The Doc2Vec model is pre-trained using AP-NEWS corpus (Lau and Baldwin, 2016), which contains 25 million documents and 0.9 billion tokens. All posts in a dicussion are concatendated as a document. Each document is converted into a Doc2Vec vector. We set the number of vector dimension as 300, which is the default value of the Doc2Vec implementation we used."

Since our computing power is limited, we randomly select 300 posts in each discussion, and convert every post into a Doc2Vec vector.
